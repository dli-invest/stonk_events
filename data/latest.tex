For it comes down to numbers in a lot of ways, but then also just do I believe I have more to offer it without question And do I aspire to be in the hall of fame?No question Do I want to do that at the cost of not spending time with my kids not being around my family?Timing is always going to be key to that We've got a good process with me in the way I lean on her a lot and I think she has a good tail tail to give me some different things to think about and she always says That's ultimately your decision but I know it's both of our decisions You're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs because you all started really young What did you learn?Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur?Probably yes I think which is a bit sad From age 5?I'm not sure I come from a family of entrepreneurs so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it It's sort of in my blood but it's really fun starting a business and fun growing a business I feel it's a real privilege and I started my business officially at 18 But I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15 But I'm sure it's you know you if you're surrounded by it feels very natural So yes it's fun And you started how you started by making you want to Florence It was an IT{-}LE and you started handbags Yeah so I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags And I remember how it made me feel and I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing The confidence boosting aspects and the tribal aspects of what fashion does And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of Leatherguss which is what interested me I just wanted to learn actually I'm be surrounded by craftsmen who I'm making things as important And that's going to be very interesting I think over the next sort of 10 years I think the on{-}shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating Actually I mean I watched the off{-}shoring and literally saw it And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local we have to When we're all looking at our objectives in terms of carbon you know Proximity is going to be key The cake is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from It's an indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure For something as universally important to human life as sleep Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s And so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there Can be harnessed to further expand our understanding It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts But if you want to be wise you really want wisdom you gotta know when and how and why to use that information And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping It seems like everything is going green these days But there's one mode of transportation that seems to be clinging to the traditional fuel loving ways And while commercial aviation has made strides through smarter design and cleaner engines Many of those gains have been nullified by more air traffic The challenge is enormous, this is a large industry, it will take decades to convert The good news is that we will have a solution as early as three years out That people can get into and start moving zero emission And it turns out that the solution could be all around us Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe And so if you had to use something it would be great The only product of the chemical reaction between hydrogen oxygen is water We looked at the fundamentals of what it would require to take an aircraft Alpinair of significant size%

Serial clean{-}tech entrepreneur Val Miftikoff started zero avia following his previous success in the EV charging industry.Hydrogen is used throughout all sections of a flight that maximizes the efficiency of the entire operation that reduces the weight provides for best sort of mission capabilities payload and range.Calling it simpler might be underselling the challenge of distributing hydrogen which unlike other fuels that can be easily transported and liquid{-}form is usually found instead in a gaseous state.John Paul Clark is the co{-}founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turbo prop market.Obviously you're gonna have to take out some seats because the energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel and you can store it in the wings practically.Example For Recording We will never break build on a foundation strong enough to stay We will never break Have a wide horizon and the mountains shake All of who will remain We will never No, now we will never No We will never We will never We will never Like zero avia, universal hydrogen is also working on engines Successfully testing their two megawatt ironbird that will allow them to retrofit planes carrying up to 55 passengers Zero avia is aiming for their first commercial hydrogen electric flight between London and Rotterdam with their 19 cedar by around 2024 But much like the range anxiety that has plagued some battery powered electric vehicles on land, hydrogen fuel cells are also fairly limited At this point they still don't have the capacity to power a common 100 passenger jet Beyond fuel cells however, there is another hope for our lightest most abundant element Burning  100 passenger jet.Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits, which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing NOx emissions.Copies then journey along the so{-}called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers.But while one big problem, vehicle cost, is improving as battery prices continue to fall, there's still another major hurdle at the other end.While the most exciting and flashy developments in the world of electric vehicles are usually around personal EVs, the more impactful transition is happening behind the scenes.So the next time you order something online and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline.Edward how do you see the publishing world changing so people buy less magazines you've been I mean you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more but in five years how does it look?%

Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships, working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets.A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services.How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back?And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud.I am excited about Kuiper which is our low earth orbit satellite that we're building you gotta remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no Internet connectivity.We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports, and to increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time.For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance.She helps meet tremendously in steering of a company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team and typically if they have a problem they share at first with her before they come to me.The company's strategic plan recognized e{-}commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation.CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it.As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business.The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistics centre at the Cologne{-}Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals.%

Intense discussion melody in I Heart, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number, this is a right approach, we convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are, where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit, they're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment.Larns by Prince William, a shot is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories.Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore, and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade.We will continue to drive impact around system{-}changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation.Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non{-}governmental activists.I have seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable.So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature{-}based solution space.So we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo{-}mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon.President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith.The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet.My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change.From a balance{-}cheap perspective, Master Card has maintained a healthy leverage ratio, even as it's put more resources into acquisitions and taken on more debt, given the company a flexibility to continue investing.%

My brother was older than I am, went to business school, he went back home and worked with my dad, got on the phone, congratulated me and said so such and what are you gonna do with your life?When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis.Like many of its counterparts in the payments and financial services industry, MasterCard has developed products and partnerships that bring cryptocurrencies into its networks.Crypto is a term that encompasses a number of different projects, including central bank digital currencies and private sector stablecoins.Because at the end of the day, sitting in my role as the CFO, strategies grade, visions fantastic, but what really matters is, can you really deliver and execute?If MasterCard can meet ambitious goals for growth in its core business and build on strategies that are taking payments to the next level, such in Merrill will deserve a lot of the credit.Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring.That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of ten didn't get back what I needed.I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem.One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle.And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017, I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities.After spending a few days with the Dominik in here in the rainy city of Portland, I've gotten an insight into a soft, spoken native Portlandian, family man, restaurant, tour, and real estate investor who's endeavoring to have more impact with his businesses than he's had against quarterbacks in the NFL.%

He's been buying and building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States, including luxury residential, office and hospitality space, and affordable housing.But his play on the field allowed him to meet and maintain relationships with future mentors in his business career, including the Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett.But his play on the field allowed him to meet and maintain relationships with future mentors in his business career, including the Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett.Moglia's career began in the coaching world, but he would rise through the ranks to lead TD Ameritrade as CEO from 2001 to 2008, and chairman from 2008 to 2020, navigating the company through the global financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as its eventual combination with Schwab.Bays opened this location only a few months before the global pandemic shut down much of the country, and George Floyd's murder led to a reckoning around racial inequality.And while coffee shops and breweries are a thing here, the real Portland is a complicated place in a state of near existential crisis facing issues around affordability, the unhoused and crime.Both Sue and I have been very fortunate and worked very hard, some lucky bounces that they win our way, and there's a whole bunch of people that we interact with in our communities that just didn't have those same opportunities, and have never had access to investing commercial real estate.While real estate investments have been a great place to store wealth, the recent housing market has left many unable to participate, especially when it comes to BIPOC communities.It may seem complicated, but Joel and Sue believe that programs like alt cap can give people who've long been excluded from real estate, an attainable investment option.If we can get real estate transactions to include everybody, you're talking about trillion dollar industry that has the ability to engage everybody in a micro fashion earned at a disproportionate rate, you can transition the wealth of our country in short order.It wasn't easy for President Biden, either, as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic petroleum reserve.And ironically, now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate, but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy.%

China's closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings.Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs.We're also potentially expecting the ECB to deliver some changes to other policies, including the cheap loans it offers to banks in the form of teletros.Ten years of remarkable growth, that's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party congress last Saturday.But Bridgewater's Ray Dahlia, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term.And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money.If you put it a longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from Deng Xiaoping?As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like and how they're going to approach the economy.The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think is very disconcerting for the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency and publication of data is not an encouraging sign.Do you have Deborah Hopes, if not expectations, that after we're through the party Congress and maybe actually after they meet in the spring and confirm that he's present in the country, that that will free President Xi up to reach out to the United States or will it embolden him to become even more assertive?I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea, which is the UK has been held back by a slow growth since the global financial crisis.And it made sense to also to be spending some money in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter.%

And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship?A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services.Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history.How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back?I do really believe that Benjamin Graham Maxson, that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine.What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers, and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building.When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis.For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance.The company's strategic plan recognized e{-}commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation.It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash and bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation.CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it.At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag.%
