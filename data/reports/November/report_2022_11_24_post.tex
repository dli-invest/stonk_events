So within each LOL surprise you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect.I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink.And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera.By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand.And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over \textbackslash{}\$10 billion in retail sales worldwide.Where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here.And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals.But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube.And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos.For MGA actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity.In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay \textbackslash{}\$3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala Loop Seedalls.But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to.%

When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated with the product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's world to ensure that we could get really quick big reach right away.I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of IbbmB, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another.With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars.Transfring to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems.If you've seen sci{-}fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be so exorbitantly expensive you would never be able to build in the first place.The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth.So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured, very energy intensive materials, to go to a site, have a solar{-}powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible.Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space, and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs.A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door.I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single living the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid in a wife.Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent.Heather, having bought her Fixer Upper site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment.%

There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times.And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50\textbackslash{}\% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing.The fighters I talked to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure.A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones.It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade.Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcaw is an 82 meter long research vessel, equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor.With more than 90\textbackslash{}\% of the ocean deeper than 200 metres, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer.Taking a bulldozer to them and planting soy and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate changes accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in.Immutation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market as soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it.So of course, in the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat.Scientists have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed.%

CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship.The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development.In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names.Other open world games felt empty and enforced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions, and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water.So Marchinavinsky, who is a co{-}founder and co{-}CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project.The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt fast of billions of dollars for multiple companies.North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding and it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home, but in some time in the 1980s.So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called basically a symmetric weapons.Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family about socialism.Muscling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs.Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores has a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the house.A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in any respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburb and house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great nieceies and they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them.%
