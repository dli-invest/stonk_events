And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stuck, that was hard to miss.And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube.You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star.And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience.But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense.And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most conserved way was MGA with their launch of LOL.So within each LOL surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you collect.Back then, you know, 2016, they were a small player of the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian.I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink.And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that, why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera?By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand.And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over \textbackslash{}\$10 billion in retail sales worldwide.%

In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom with Sue MGA, for breach of contract, after it failed to pay \textbackslash{}\$3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loopsy dolls.When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away.Their kid is watching other kids{-}  Prior and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing That's a commercial for a toy their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way Which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way In just a few short years YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys a cartoon series He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade You and I might think about Spider{-}Man or Snoopy But today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him He's the character they want to grow up with he's he's the character that what they want to engage with and as we go forward These influencers are becoming more and more like big giant global brands and that has profound effects For entertainment going forward Air BnB is huge today on any given night you could have as many as two million people staying in an Air BnB all around the world You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers The vast majority of Air BnB stays don't result in a safety incident But sometimes things go wrong and for Air BnB, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year That the company has to handle and has to respond to I'm talking situations like kidnappings hostage cases.We're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society Happen inside Air BnBs Air BnB never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines You know that's really bad for their their brand their reputation and their public image Particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model I'm Olivia Carville.I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another.With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agencies ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars.I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple it really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so and that's really it.If you've seen sci{-}fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed into the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place.The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth.Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs.A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door.Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent.%

This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers.There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times.On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa, LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Quarry and John Fitch attached to the suit.A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well.And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the anti{-}trust laws, it would pay its fighters 50\textbackslash{}\% or more of the revenues generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing.The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure.A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones.It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade.M u fel ffeid yn roi'n eu cyllunu'r crefi deithbyddol honog gyfodad unrhyw os ymais roed.Gok er Box clappingil am jfaithbo pwyrgych eileg yn chi hyngrydu weithwagingu 505 cyhatig yngredau bod emphasize a libletor y template clar hefnydoddiu f Terrae exact.We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soybean corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in.Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed.%

Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China{-}Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC, the Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship.The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red.The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development.In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names.There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end.Other open world games felt empty and enforced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water.So Marchinavinsky, who's a co{-}founder and co{-}CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crouch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project.The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies.So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called basically a symmetric weapons.The worst solution comes from this, with those  finishing tables, Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health.A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in any respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACI's, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them.%

When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people.In 1968 Avantiunard and four friends including Doug Tomkins the late founders of the North Face brand embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina.It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion.The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket.During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism.As the company branched out into other areas, including adventure capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017.Because of the image that the brand projects and so they have to deal with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success.So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office.It's the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self{-}driving cars, why can't you fix this now?So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long{-}term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack, rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top.Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete.Gordon raised in India, Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine.%

You know, your market cap elevation is an effect of the value you provide and I feel fortunate our mission is timeless.The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health.That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me.Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day.The same way today, for example, in India, over one{-}third of the queries on many phones come through voice, but it's something people take for granted, you can do it.And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy.Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau.Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers.But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant.The segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things.And it's been great to have Jeff, you know, win on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business.Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias.%

So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning which is required to create, you know, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS.So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS and we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future.I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users.Currently, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens.And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real{-}world harm.And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are, how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice.The potential long{-}term impacts of YouTube on teams and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with, not just as a CEO, but as a mom?You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then.She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horowitz.However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do.That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed.And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped.%

In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for, and Mr. Trump's candidacy.To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, best{-}less CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael, his chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JPM We're going to asset management.And you had some of that when Leiborne talked, but you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for one longer than she had implied.The reality is for the last couple of weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty.We said oil prices did the future numbers went down below 80, which was a big shift from a little while ago, but my view is still that we might just avoid a recession in the US if we're fortunate.That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000 when the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2.Having this particular, you know, FTX, which is an exchange core crypto, be based in the Bahamas with not just no regulation, but also with a few people who have very limited experience in finance or in anything, really, run it.I think as said, what is very interesting right now is even in any foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage, you're finding exactly the same phenomenon where people had moved away from bonds and cash.And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been the fact that developing countries, again, have felt that they are in some cases suffering, because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater.And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate{-}related food and egg, in battery storage, in residential and in community{-}related solar and wind.It's time to look at what's up next week on global Wall Street, starting with Annabelle Droolers in Hong Kong.%

Thursday, CES{-}RATE decision by Sweden's Riksbank, economist forecast a 75 basis point hike, but surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more.A handful of earnings next week to watch, including Zoom video, deer, analog devices, S{-}by, and Nordstrom, keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.It's an excellent point because typically monetary policy does operate with a lag so the Fed wants to look ahead and indeed for example governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of of the year and I appreciate that point my own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do I think the challenge they face David is that quite frankly the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good including what I was there last year and so I think it's going to be a balance between adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data Richard is not just the rates that are going on we also have so{-}called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet which had gone so far up give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States.And what are possible options if they do conclude there's an issue there one of my suppose would be reversing and going back to quantitative easing that's one way to do it another might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 great financial crisis which really is i used to took a lot of the big banks and it limited their participation in the market.And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation.The United States back in the game with respect to climate in Shammel Shake the meeting with Xi I don't think this G20 will be long remembered but at a very vexing moment there could have been some kind of breakdown and there certainly was not that.Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time the collapse of Sam Bankman freeds FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people wiping out in one fell swoop what was estimated to be a \textbackslash{}\$32 billion empire leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag.All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman Fried.Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade.I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages.We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation.%

And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult, it'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership.So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature{-}based solution space.And we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon.The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet.My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change.I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum.But the big question facing companies now is how to navigate a potentially prolonged economic downturn, joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 DoorDash CEO and co{-}founder Tony Shoe.Yeah, I, you know, it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school, Jack Dorsey and Keith where we're trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full time.I was driving for a lot of different services to try to actually understand you know logistics You know my background I mean as you mentioned more in engineering math I thought I was going to be a cancer researcher I mean that's pretty much what I spent all of my undergraduate days at Berkeley doing That kind of 180'd into world of business But and so I think it's really important to really learn things for yourself You know to think from first principles kind of you know again back to that independent thinking mindset I talked about as a child growing up and you try for Uber lift I even drove for you know services that were a little bit older and a services like FedEx or Domino's and really try to explore You know how does delivery work and is really trying to understand you know every component part I mean it sounds really simple right bring you a Burrito from point A to point B But there were actually twenty steps involved in that delivery It just didn't appear as obvious to the you know naked eyes of the first two years of door to ashes life We did deliveries almost every single day So where did you go from there?I know Elon Musk has said starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death One of the first ones came actually as early as month three of the company's life So we were maybe 11 weeks 12 weeks old as a company There was a big Stanford football game in September and you know long story short We were laid on every single order and we had no ability to turn off the site So it was just horrendous everyone in the company all 12 of us were delivering and everyone You know rightfully so it was furious because of how lately we were and so we had a decision to make You know do we do the right thing and refund you know every single customer which would have cost us about 40\textbackslash{}\% of our bank account Or do we you know do a less right and and survive another day because it was very hard for us at that time to raise capital Which you know was something true for door ashes early history and You know it took us about 30 seconds to click submit free fund and you know the lesson for us Always as a founding team and frankly even today as a as a company is we'd rather die chasing excellence than live to be mediocre It wasn't so obvious either in the in the earlier years I remember in 2016 you did a down{-}round I think you you actually came on the show around that time How did you weather the doubters and the you know the people who didn't believe there were about a thousand days in the desert Between 2016 17 and 18 sometimes with company building So long as you can convince yourself because time is your you know most precious resource You should keep going and if you can keep going long enough you might get lucky enough to make it so over time How did you balance quality with the need and desire to scale and then scale globally in these types of businesses where it's low{-}margin high complexity You really have to figure out what your unit of business is you know for us that was a city So in order to before going to 7000 or 10,000 cities globally we made one city work and After city one worked we made city to work and after we started getting higher and higher confidence that we can make baskets of cities work Irrespective of the of the geographies or what you know the customer situation look like or what the merchant makeup was Then we gained the confidence to actually roll out everywhere then came the pandemic Brian Cheskey has said the pandemic was like a torpedo for Airbnb Was it like the opposite for doordash?It was like the biggest wave behind her back which you know had the ability to break us And and it almost did because we grew 2x talking about in 2019 to today five businesses in 27 countries You know much more than just restaurants and and so all of that was created in the last two years The big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation?Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades.%

This is not, or the hour itself knows by the minute and then it'll fall, come back, and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid.The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries.We're seeing more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for.A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth.I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue.And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world.Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like, as Barclays, you're one of the players in selling and buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying, that the volatility was managed extremely well by the very effective, targeted, and time{-}bound actions of the Bank of England.So once Brexit happened, and you could not pass vote financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe.Alphabet Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start.Had in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world.For no coastal points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world.Indians make up about three{-}fourths of the immigrants receiving coveted H{-}1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the capital.%

And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia or China or Iran, you'll see the same kind of deep consultation and engagement between the two countries that you've seen before, regardless of who's president, regardless of who's prime minister.Second, it was a UN mediator working with our U.S. envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.And then we also bring in other cabinet members, depending on what the subjects are being briefed, so that the President gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week.So when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the Secretary of State, side{-}vants, and the National Security Adviser as a big brazen ski.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading or told the allies more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe it was going to happen.And I think Ukraine is in a position now today to ensure that they will remain a strong sovereign viable independent state, even as they continue to try to resist Russian aggression on a portion of their territory.Hard core boxing fans who are the beating heart of the sport are a small minority versus a potential audience for a YouTube fight between KSI and Logan Paul.music on the David Rubenstein Show here to peer conversations I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television music welcome back to Bloomberg Power Players it was 2018 and Eddie Hurn signed a groundbreaking broadcasting agreement with the streaming giant DeZone the deal with his company Matrim boxing was worth a billion dollars over eight years making Hurn the sports first billion dollar promoter let's rejoin Danny Berger who puts Eddie Hurn on the spot about big TV deals you first heard yourself called a billion dollar promoter what do they make you think?and my response was yeah absolutely that's made because I think if you're going into a marketplace with no brand presence no brand profile you have to make waves, you have to create noise and I'm not a believer in moving in quietly and slowly taking our time but you know there was a debate going on this maybe that was an approach that worked for us but I don't feel that's my mantra or my start you know I wanted to go in there I wanted to be a disruptor you talk about a jacket work?Recently Eddie Hurn promoted the fight between the Irish Boxer Katie Taylor and the Puerto Rican fighter Amanda Serrano.In women's boxing, maybe it's just one fight in the division, but that's changing because these individuals are setting the standard, raising the bar, paving the way for young female fighters to actually have a big future within the sport.%

The reality is, for the last couple of weeks, you could have moved your portfolio in any direction you wanted, up and down duration, up and down credit risk without any kind of penalty.We had a team out in Asia as this week and they came back with interesting news that there is actually some physical opening up, but now you have people who are afraid to go out because they've been told so long that if they go out, they'll get COVID.And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries, again, have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater, if they are affected by droughts and by floods.Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you because one of the things that I'm taking away from COP27, you can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject.And I think that will really help us in the U.S. to invest a lot more in climate{-}related food and ag, in battery storage, in residential and in community{-}related solar and wind.A handful of earnings next week to watch including Zoom video, deer, and along devices best by Ann Nordstrom, keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday.The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash{-}strapped consumers that seem willing to spend, but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago.Another might be actually to ameliorating some of their restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an issue that took a lot of the big banks and were limited to their participation in the market.And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, laps, that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasury reserves in that leverage calculation.Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy and fiscal stimulus and things, but geoponetics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with  I'm going to come down.Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolitics have also factored increasingly in some of the issues having to do with the economy.And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India helped drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism?%

Be very careful about giving China the sense that we are trying to change the traditional one{-}shina policy, because I think that could risk disaster conflict.And if we change our focus from building ourselves up to tearing China down, I think we will be making a very risky and very unfortunate choice.Despite that endorsement from the greatest quarterback of all time, the collapse of Sam Bankman{-}Fried's FTX has brought heartbreak to a lot of people.Wiping out in one fell swoop, what was estimated to be a \textbackslash{}\$32 billion empire, leaving what its lawyers now say could be as many as a million creditors holding the bag.The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of \textbackslash{}\$186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment.All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader, and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman freed.Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank.She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at venture firm and recent Horowitz.However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do.One of the things that we told our LPs, even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle.And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania, back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities.The tape is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure.%

There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, and then ground vehicles or a manual vessels, perhaps providing a menu selection and control room environment, maybe in a nuclear power station.Well I think it's really interesting isn't it because the minute players stand up and voice their concerns everyone sells them stay out of politics stick to football.Beth Mead of course hugely successful strikers she's done so well in the game she's just winning all these accolades she's scat herself she said it's just so disappointing and it's quite a big thing to see not going to watch it when you play football for a living.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.I always think they don't really get the criticism in other people with, in other sports even you know you earn lots of money like gold for Formula 1 or you can even go in other routes like actors, huge actors get earned fortunes, musicians, brilliant musicians, they are, if you are in the entertainment industry you do get paid a lot of money but no one else gets that football.I honestly think that mostly though, like the massive majority of footballers would be really good lads, well behaved, work really, really hard on what they do and live properly because you have to do now because it is so competitive.Here in the UK, the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, when asked about football as wages during the lockdown during the pandemic, said, quote, everybody needs to play that part in this national effort.He's now in Australia taking part in a reality TV show called, I'm a celebrity, get me asked for, been suspended as a conservative MP.But there are obviously more serious issues that he was, you know, he was a large part of the early days with, you know, so many deaths in COVID and some, you know, they would throw the blame at the government in terms of the lack of protection certainly in care homes and things like that.A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars.Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors' championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets.For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance.%

If Bitcoin isn't good at crime, then how can it live up to its promise as a stateless currency that could allow people in oppressed areas to transact with one another without a regulator seeing what they're up to?And sitting aside, what one's view of the protestware, which I think is like kind of irrelevant to the question, the point is, if there's going to be a moment where people needed a form of money that could like, they could transact without censorship.Because if you read those indictments, you'll see that intelligence officers were using crypto to buy servers within the United States to try to sort of obscure their tracks and use that to basically purchase the infrastructure that they then used to launch the hacks into the DNC emails and all that.But if you go past just like darkened markets and drug trafficking or even the aspects of child exploitation sites are also being leveraged on that, the other type of crime is not necessarily financially driven.I'm wondering if what you heard from Joe Weisenthal makes sense that this stuff in order for it to actually serve its promise as a stateless currency and help people who are oppressed, it has to become better at crime.There's a lot of positive use cases for crypto generally or for distributed ledger technology, which is what all of the stuff is based on that, you know, often people are overlooking, right?Yeah, I think you can strip the crypto conversation out of that because North Korea has been engaging in this kind of maligned cyber activity for years.So crypto certainly makes it, you know, a more interesting conversation because there are certain things that nation state actors can do that they couldn't do more, you know, as easily in a purely kind of analog world.Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring.I guess this week is the award{-}winning Nigerian writer and author, Jim Amanda Nungotsi Aditriet, named by Time magazine as one of its most influential people.I think how religious institutions use their power over individuals, but also how intersects with politics is in people's minds, especially in America at the moment since Roe v.

But you do express this concern at this particular quote you say, we have a generation of young people on social media, so terrified of having the wrong opinions, that they've robbed themselves of the opportunity to think and to learn and to grow.In 2019, CEO Antonio Mary announced that the company would pivot from a focus on servers and on{-}site storage systems to its cloud software as a service platform, GreenLake.Companies that once invested heavily in devices and data center servers may now take more flexibility from software that can be upgraded as new needs arise.Coming up, why a company with deep roots in Silicon Valley just opened a new headquarters in Houston and how it designed its campus for a more flexible future.HPE Chief Financial Officer, Taurik Robiyade, originally trained as a scientist, earning a master's degree in nuclear physics and electronics.Highlights from Robiyade's resume include a stint with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australia.Distant with Lehman Brothers in London and later experiences CEO first with the telecommunications firm CSL in Hong Kong and then with Australian financial services company Flexi Group.HPE has an abandoned Silicon Valley, a number of employees and business units remain based in the Bay Area.We have to coach our colleagues and team members and my job the way I think about it is we have to shine the spotlight on their strength but also at the same time make sure that we understand our weaknesses and are clear about the areas that we need to improve.A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services.How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back?And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud.%

And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort, the players poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete.I think NIL could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA grades.O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name image and likeness.And then on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals.So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a Zoom or something like that, I either chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or, you know, go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples.Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey, and Abdul Jabbar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow.When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee.I think we're getting ready to stop boxes on a few of the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than \textbackslash{}\$13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program.A great investor firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth.And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world.She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture firm and recent Horowitz.Here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank, and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem.%

One of the things that we told our LPs, even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle.And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities.I guess some time older people go to work end Scanning gets there and get lots of imagine the heat of drugs, doingida or alcohol borrow very hard and get a full ton of where Steve would go behind line and he'd see somebody cutting an onion and saying, well hold on, let me show you how to do it.I've got to make sure that the financials, the balance sheet, the way we source through, the way that we provide through, the way that our business works, needs to be strong so that we reach our full potential.All this, despite a global pandemic that's disrupted the restaurant industry and all this following a food safety crisis that caused sales at the company to crater and forced a shake{-}up in the sea suite.So there's little reason for Chipotle to begin franchising in the United States but for the chain's 45 international restaurants Bloomberg intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion.When you think about our system, there are a lot of processes that frankly, people don't love doing cutting, incurring avocados in the restaurant, not a fun job, very repetitive.It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to will put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally and do customers like it.For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis.I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new that you've been following in the last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities.Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.%
