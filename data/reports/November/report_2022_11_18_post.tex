We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to develop.It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them.So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cause of like some time they could have been spending on the game.The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting{-}edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself.They saw over 8 million pre{-}orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre{-}sell.I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020.And afterwards, they started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem.The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems.Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch.So Marchinewinsky, who is a co{-}founder and co{-}CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project.Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers.The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December.%

And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us.Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures.The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies.North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding.Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever message, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism.Ustling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs.A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great nieceies.This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out, very implicit, running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office.In 1968, Yvonne Schonard and four friends, including Dag Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina.It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion.As the company branched out into other areas including Adventure Capital Fund for Environmental Causes and Sustainable Food, Revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017.After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co{-}founders lured her to Silicon Valley.%

There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made and then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well and I just wanted that next chapter.On my view in my career I've always been focused on and I've continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time.So I think the the narrative was written before I got here and what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long{-}term growth.What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times so the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and and so you know there was that was really clear during the financial crisis the financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity you couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate you need to do that ahead of time it needs to be all of the work we do on trust and  and do it in the moment.Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans, your ability to compete?And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meeker, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison.I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it.From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust.The Facebook follow out, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health.Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day.You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion.%

And and when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online.Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau.Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers.But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come, and I would maintain forever, is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next, and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things.Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias.So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS.I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users.So, to keep you safe, and remember, it's important to continue ring JERRY around the world to get aibly blended into the cloud workload.Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens.We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources.And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real{-}world harm.And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice.%

As US retail sales charge ahead, the fate pushes back against the pivot narrative, San Francisco President Mary Daly now seems raised rising to between 4.75 and 5.25\textbackslash{}\%.But let's just change it on quick look across the border market landscape as well, because we are broadly risk off in the session today, really being led as well, you said, by other factors, like what you mentioned, retail sales, and also that more hawkishness still coming through from the Fed.Norman, I mean, I return back to a line from Bloomberg reporting around a requirement from the Chinese government for lenders to deliver on some of the details on bond exposure.Chinese President Xi Jinping confronted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G20 summit, accusing him of leaking details of a private meeting.After two months of delays blamed on weather and technical glitches, the Orion capsule built by Lockheed Martin will come within 100 kilometers of the lunar surface early next week before returning to Earth December 11th.We'll talk Middle East market strategy with Artichetra Secre and I'll show a capital who thinks the getting inflation under control, Euphoria is totally overdone.Typically though, we found in the second half of an administration, the president does focus more on foreign policy because it's one area that he has more authority and doesn't have to clear of a lot of it with Capitol Hill.And what is not going to happen is a broadening out of the commitment to face out unabated coal use to all fossil fuels, snuffing efforts by India and a key set of developed nations to include oil and gas under a bigger deal at COP27.The loss and damage component is going to be added once the draft is finalized, opposition to including fossil fuel usage would of course come from countries like Saudi Arabia where there was concern that push back from their side would stop.This is the state of playing the last trading session broadly negative as investors reacted to geopolitical news in terms of tensions between the U.S. and China.I want to flip the board and get to the Treasury's trade because that is front and center as we think about the economic data we got overnight in terms of retail sales and the long list of Fed voices that chimed in as well.And then also these recession risks that we saw in the Tuesdays, curve, particularly most inverted since the early 80s, also in those longer duration debts, including the Aussie 10 year yield at dropping 10 basis points.%

A very strong statement from National Security Advisor in the US, Jake Sullivan, who said that there is no justification for the incident, and that it fits a, quote, pattern of such actions and broader destabilizing activities by Iran in the region.But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwashed the World Cup and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.However, organizers argue that this World Cup will be more energy efficient than others since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit.David McLennan spoke to Bloomberg at the new economy forum and called on world leaders to keep borders open to improve food security and bring down prices.And the situation, what will it take to have sustainably lower prices to ease this food inflation that's really making a lot of people go hungry, especially in developing and emerging economies?In the Pazi Chapel, the marvelous architecture by Felipe Brunalesci, the most important images from the Divine Comedy created by the French illustrator Gustaf Dore.Face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today seeking destabilized public finances.Face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today, seeking to stabilize public finances amid economic headwinds.Plus, US Republicans flip the house by a narrow margin, giving the GOP power to thought President Biden's agenda in the second half of his term.Suvastry Ghost brings us latest developments in the ever{-}evolving crypto saga, while Lizzie Burton is on hand at Westminster to preview Jeremy Hunt's pivotal autumn statement.Looking forward to the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50 basis point hike.Yeah, it feels like, you know, with the way the CPI and PPI prints have come in recently, that we could be reaching the stage where we can start to talk about at least, you know, the rate hike pace slowing a bit.%

Mark, so do you write off then China, for example, signing off on the communique that said most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and the fact that Xi was there talking to various world partners?I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum.Led down by tech, Asia stocks follow Wall Street into the red as a sell{-}off in Chinese technology shares intensifies.US Republicans flip the house by a narrow margin giving the GOP power to thwart President Biden's agenda in the second half of his term.And face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today, seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds.But this is being driven by 10 cents, the internet giant pulling back from some of its investments and that underlining the negatives and the threats to Chinese tech stocks.There are numerous challenges facing the economy with the former Bank of England NPC member Michael Saunders saying Brexit's impact still looms large.But the new chancellor has said we're going to have eye{-}wateringly difficult decisions when it comes to tax rises and spending cuts, because he's got to plug the hole in the public finances, tame inflation, and grow the economy.Up next, though, we will have more on the UK Chancellor's Jeremy Hans highly anticipated budget statement as he seeks to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds.Despite concerns about Biden's handling of the economy, voters delivered a split verdict over who was to blame with issues such as abortion rights and threats to democracy also in focus.And I think actually that's perhaps the hardest judgment for Jeremy Hunt, to what extent does he need to do spending cuts or indeed tax rises relatively swiftly in order to provide kind of insurance that he's really serious about taking physical sustainability as a very important matter to give that credibility and that reassurance to the markets.So even if the chance of didn't put up taxes, we think it would probably be running at about the highest level the UK has ever sustained in its history.%

And face into the storm UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today, seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds.We're seeing things like US inflation is cooling, which is causing the dollar to soften yields to rally a bit in the US, which means that this kind of borrowing maybe won't shock the market as aggressively as it did back in September.Now let's get back to the markets and the Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said economic data over the past few weeks has made him quote, more comfortable with the idea of moderating the central bank's pace of interest rate hikes in December.thwys presenting faint, hwn ddi http ysddym i architect <|cy|><|translate|><|cy|><|translate|> aion ymg chi'n ddodd syd a fydd nhw i am agynolal sewoodau mo.Dusty nosach gendo hawdo felly rhucyrone  Kas yn rhan oes 157 dinig Regge configurFI au pu contentiol giwayna practicio o mould encrypted Cynarrel Ddi cael Bemys Greati Ys i sicrhau ac meddwl wedryng arall mae mutior a lle clarl i dydrafn.Felly'n gw incomingol yn yna cadawill i ddynel weldau syddinsadle nhw'r Lonl{-} Nigostra** yr Hymno, wrth gydmouth nig endings.Next up, we will look at your stocks to watch including Zeeman's, the German engineering, giant CIOs, higher margins in its three key divisions next year, defying pressure from a global economic slowdown.And really what folks are attributing to this too is the fact that Americans with a strong dollar with a weak euro went overseas and bought Burberry clothes and North America's sales for their own part dropped.Face into the storm UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds.Let down by tech Asia stocks follow Wall Street into the red as a sell off in Chinese technology shares intensifies the dollar snaps a two day decline and the Ukrainian president for the new economy forum in Singapore will bring you this hour.So warning from the people's bank of China that inflation could pause and pose something they've challenged with an economy making maybe the policy response a little bit more muted in the months and quarters ahead from Chinese officials.The Spanish Ibex currently at two tenths of a percent here in the U.S.  was and posed something that were challenged with an economy making maybe the policy response a little bit more muted in the months and quarters ahead from Chinese officials.%

We're now discussing with the EU to close the deficit gap for 2023 and the support for the Ukrainian budget in the amount of 18 billion next year or a soul of underline confirmed this capability and the political world to do so and that will be able to get that.If not now, then in the future, as a place to invest their money, whether in infrastructure energy or agricultural and deep technology and IT, there was also the question about the support that Brussels is sending to Ukraine, whether that is indeed sufficient.We're going to speak to Conservative MP Harriet Bulldoin recently elected to chair of the Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, a very important individual within the context of this autumn statement.I think it's really important that the UK demonstrate today that we can pay our way and after the guardrails, as you put them slightly fell away during September and October, that we are back on track and well{-}guarded on all sides by the institutional strength of the United Kingdom.Okay, thinking about today's fiscal statement then, given the Prime Minister's criticism of nurses' demands for double digit pay rises, do bankers deserve uncap to bonuses this year?Well, I think that's one of the many things that were announced in September that have been rode back on, I'm not sure what we'll, whether we'll hear uneychegioud al iawn i'n cyplod REMRD bus i gyda ynaenge beth ramogaeth a RT centre Gally mwy, goflodnych ar y unain gweith amserau cy gemeill itis!!!!!!!!!!!We have taken evidence on the committee from people like the Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Who might they should show you put your salary on that?DIO policing hawr y Giamsel ha?There seems to be this push and pull between market exuberance and Fed officials who come and try and poor cold water because they're worried about the loosening and the easing of financial conditions.Let down by tech, Asia stocks follow Wall Street into the red as a sell{-}off in Chinese technology shares and intensifies the dollar snaps a two{-}day decline.Face into the storm, UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivers his highly anticipated budget statement today seeking to stabilize the public finances amid economic headwinds.We're going to get a couple more questions to you, but I want to bring in JP Morgan Asset Management's global head of multi{-}asset strategy, John Bilton now, very pleased to say joining us in the studio.And yet the PBOC coming out today saying, warning that maybe inflation is creeping up and concerned that that may hamstring them at least restrict the ability for them to add additional stimulus and support for that economy.%

It translates to a similar kind of picture, which is, you know, but for a little bit arounding a positive real interest rate at the front of the US curve at the beginning, you know, during the first half of next year.Now, coming up, we're going to hear from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke with Bloomberg's editor and chief John Mikkelfrey from the new economic forum in Sing{-}A{-}Pore.Now the fallout from the rapid collapse of FTX is spreading across the crypto world, ensnaring the binulair Winklevoss twins through a liquidity squeeze at their lending partner, Genesis.For in{-}house attorneys who strived provide superior counsel and strategic advice, Bloomberg Law offers an unmatched platform of analytics tools and business intelligence.And after the guardrails, it's as you put them, sort of slightly fell away during September and October, that we are back on track and well{-}guarded on all sides by the institutional strength of the United Kingdom.I mean, as you've already been discussing, the government faces a very tricky balancing act here to show credibility on the public finances, get boring and debt under control, whilst not unnecessarily aggravating the recession that's coming.Alex, there is a sense, and Lizzie was saying that describing it as kind of naked, politicking around the back loading of some of these measures, post, of course, the election has to be held by January 2025 or the latest.Well, we can discover new features including John Stubbex, free daily newsletter, money distilled Bloomberg's selling service edition is in the next hour.Start because COVID{-}19 has stopped the project that was shared by the opera de Santi Coche by the Franciscan community from Florence Municipality and the fun for religious building of the internal minister.In the Pazi Chapel, the marvelous architecture by Felipo Brunolessi, the most important images from the divine comedy created by the French illustrator Gustaf Dore.And a power shift on Capitol Hill, Republicans narrowly regain control of the House, giving them the ability to block President Biden's agenda.But as you say, muted sentiment overall, and it was definitely in the more downward direction in the Asian session overnight, stocks there broadly lower the MSTI Asia Pacific index down by about eight tenths of one percent.%

But the reason that Jeremy Hunt is having to make these decisions is that it is Steve indeed this gaping hole in the public finances And I was speaking to the Treasury Select Committee Chairwoman Harriet Baldwin earlier.Here she is explaining why that's so important It's really important that the UK demonstrate today that we can pay our way and after the guardrail that says you put them sort of slightly fell away during September and October that we are back on on track and well guarded on all sides by the institutional strength of the United Kingdom But Jeremy Hunt is facing into the storm as we have been briefed he has to tame inflation But that will require weighing on demand so it's a very very fine line between pleasing the markets and pleasing the voters Yeah, I don't envy Mr. Hunt.Thanks very much Bloomberg's Lizzie burden there reporting on the autumn What do you call it the autumn statement correct the autumn statement coming out all of a sudden we all know what this is after well Liz trusted one great thing for the UK all right Ukraine's prime President I should say of a lot of mirrors Zalensky has laid out his conditions for peace Zalensky says ceasefire Won't be enough and only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow and end to the war speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore Zalensky also weighed in on the missile that struck Poland earlier this week I don't know what happened this time we don't know 100\textbackslash{}\% I think the world also does know what happened 100\textbackslash{}\% in that situation But I'm sure that this is a Russian missile and I'm sure that we were launching the Air Defense missiles, but we can't say specifically that this was the air defense of Ukraine although we are grateful for not being blamed Because we are fighting against the Russian missiles in our territory, but nevertheless We have to be fair and honest Until the investigation is over.You've heard that throughout the past 24 hours But it's kind of an intense Awkward moment because you have Zalensky really pitting himself in terms of what has gone what happened in Poland Against his main allies and that is of course the US and all of NATO Back in Washington where you spend most of your time Emory We have of course a changing of the gardener sense in the house the GOP retaking the US House By a slim margin in a power shift in Washington that stops shorter the Senate of course.When it comes to the markets, what everyone really will probably start to focus on is the fact that we have the debt ceiling issue, and the Republicans may use this opportunity to use that hostage to force the president to enact spending cuts.Budget Day in the UK, Jeremy Hunt will try to reassure markets he can stabilize public finances without devastating cuts in government services.And a power shift on Capitol Hill Republicans narrowly regain control of the House, giving them the ability to block President Biden's agenda.Matt, European equity markets a little bit weaker in the early part of the trading session, waiting for the set piece event that is the autumn statement here in the UK, basically a budget and looking at US futures.Ziemann helps Germany to outperform and though the engineering giants up by seven percent they reported numbers and it seems to this the factory automation side of the business that is structurally doing pretty well right now at least according to analysts.Right now we have Prime Minister Rishi Sunag speaking in the House of Commons or at least he is getting ready to he's going to be delivering some remarks there he is on his return from the G20 in barley giving his thoughts he of course had a meeting with President Biden and he was quite outspoken in his criticism of China thank you.Yep but and of course really what we're watching for in the House of Commons is an hour from now as you said when we received the autumn statement from Jeremy Hunt that has major implications for the trajectory of growth and inflation in the UK economy joining us now to discuss it is Chris Hare he is HSBC's senior economist Chris obviously this is a very hard line to walk where you don't want to do too much restrictive in order to take growth but also they need to get spending under control what is your expectation of what the balance struck will be today.Yes it's really tough task for Chancellor Jeremy Hunt I think we're looking out for a couple of things the first is the size of this so{-}called fiscal black hole that a lot of people have been banding around figures up to around 50 60 billion pounds or so and of course then House of Fillet what kind of mix we're going to see in terms of tax rises and spending cuts but I think most interesting for me is the timing by which this fiscal belt tightening will happen so from our perspective we think that there's at least a chunk of backloading that's going to happen in terms of this belt tightening i.e. certain tax rises and spending cuts that we extended out to 2025 or 2026 or so such that the pain in terms of the macroeconomic headwinds will at least be smoothed out somewhat but again that raises a credibility question if you're backloading your fiscal tightening by so much then there are questions about well will it actually happen eventually.%

Get a gopennath, really excellent on this over at NEF and Singapore talking about how we don't have a sense of how much you're going to end up with all of these together moves from our central banks on the world, what the effects are going to be in hydromatic.The PhD from Indiana, newly{-}mended Michelle Bowman, Loretta Master, an arch{-}mathematician from Cleveland, Philip Jefferson with terrific social economic credibility as a Fed governor in the aerospace engineer from Minneapolis.And I've been saying this for quite some time, I don't think that the Bank of England has the

Zelensky of Ukraine, which comes right over to the first order of business for a Republican House.He wants to send Ukrainian officials to Poland, and the president, when he got off Marie Wan, and before he went into the White House, was asked about these claims from Zelensky, he said that the evidence doesn't show that.And he had some interesting choice words about making sure that there's not

Boris and trust I believe we're now gonna go to the House of Commons for a hugely anticipated speech here is the chancellor of the East Jacker I'll worry about the future so today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy Our priorities are stability growth and public services We also protect the vulnerable because to be British is to be compassionate and this is a compassionate We are not alone in facing these problems But today we respond to an international crisis with British values We are honest about the challenges and we are fair in our solutions Yes, we take difficult decisions to tackle inflation and keep mortgage rates down But our plan also leads to a shallower downturn lower energy bills higher growth and a stronger NHS and education system Three priorities then today stability growth and public services I start with stability Mr. Speaker high inflation is the enemy of stability It means higher mortgage rates more expensive food and fuel bills businesses failing and unemployment rising It erodes savings causes industrial unrest and cuts funding for public services It hurts the poorest the most and eats away at the trust upon which a strong society is built The Office for Budget Responsibility confirms global factors are the primary cause of current inflation Most countries are still dealing with a fallout from a once in a century pandemic The furlough scheme the vaccine rollout and the response of the NHS did our country proud But they all have to be paid for the lasting impact on supply chains has made goods more expensive and Fueled inflation and this has been met worsened by a made in Russia energy crisis Putin's war in Ukraine has caused wholesale gas and electricity prices To rise to eight times their historic average inflation is high here but higher in Germany than Netherlands and Italy Interest rates have risen here but faster in the US Canada and New Zealand Growth forecast to fallen here but fallen further in Germany the international monetary fund expect one Third of the world's economy to be in recession this year or next So the Bank of England which has done an outstanding job since its independence now has my whole hearted support in its mission To defeat inflation and I date today confirm we will not change its remit But we need fiscal and monetary policy to work together and that means the government and the bank working in lockstep It means in particular giving the world confidence in our ability to pay our debts British families make sacrifices every day to live within their means and so too must their government because the united kingdom will always  i ardect.Yesterday's inflation figures show that we must continue a relentless fight to bring it down, including a rock{-}solid commitment to rebuild our public finances.Today's decisions mean that over the next five years, Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer were the forecast widely anticipated and very much different from the Bank of England.11.1\textbackslash{}\% is idiosyncratic to also the United Kingdom and to Europe based on the energy crisis, but it is being felt around the world and the

And then you had a positive divergence develop at that October low where under the surface, the breadth actually was a bit improved relative to what we saw in in June.I think that was the knee jerk reaction on Thursday and Friday, the buying went back into some of those down the quality spectrum prior speculation driven areas of the market.Were the moving parts of this in the dynamic, the heart of the matter is longer maturity bonds are bid up, price up, and their yield comes in and that forces the inversion, right?In the UK, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is outlining a series of tax hikes and spending cuts aimed at getting public finances under control.More than a week after the elections, Republicans have won a narrow majority in the House that gives him the power to halt President Biden's agenda.From the financial centers of the world, Bloomberg markets European plows with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Steele in New York.If you're in the game of global Wall Street, the gentleman from San Francisco in New York, John Williams Air, yes, are starred with a blistering two sentences.And he comes home to what I'm gonna say with a immense respect for the lady of Baltimore and then her San Francisco speaker Pelosi that is front and center.It's interesting when you look at the Republican Party because on one hand, of course, we've talked about this all week, Ken Griffin, Steve Schwartzman, these individuals no longer want to back the president.What did the Republicans not get out the message that they wanted, which was it was the Biden administration or the Democrats fault for things that all of the constituents across America feel were just higher inflation.Sarah, I had a line that I'm going to say as an amateur launches back to Clement Atley and maybe the reason why Churchill was shown the door after World War II, the United Kingdom Office of Budget Responsibilities sees record fall in household disposable income.And indeed, the chancellor was doubling down on some of the, removing some of the EU regulations that apparently are holding back the UK, but that's not necessarily going to be kickstarting growth anytime soon.%

as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned the resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s my name is Jeff Mesh, I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles, I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign the Philippines is a really interesting country it's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America, American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines they're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music for example they love all things America and that extends to their their love for soft drinks Pepsi Cola Coca{-}Cola in the 1990s it was everywhere Pepsi and Coca{-}Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars it was a fierce battle for market dominance number fever was already a really popular promotion it had been rolled out in America to great success and so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally particularly in Asia they thought it was the answer to their problems they thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor a million pesos or six j{-}eight thousand dollars doesn't sound like a lot now but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money you've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about a hundred dollars so a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations number fever caught fire in the Philippines kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags you would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps it was a national phenomenon Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from ten million dollars to fourteen million dollars it had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line number fever quickly became number hysteria maids were being jailed for stealing their employers winning bottle caps there was even some murders over over winning bottle caps people were fighting in the streets over these caps there were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number they'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots there were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball so in 1992 Pepsi decided  The

Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities.That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system.It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex.And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads.It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at Calling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place.It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation.It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to.There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well.And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy, in a sense of a music control especially during the pandemic.And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e{-}commerce.In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country.Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the wave roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt.%

So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost{-}effective.In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop.But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment, to the estimated tune of around \textbackslash{}\$60 million US dollars per kilometer of track.And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing.Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track.Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make.Andrew Forrest's better known as Twiggy made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners.But after having made over \textbackslash{}\$10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company.There was probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen.Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference and he policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now, okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi{-}billion dollar agreements, we now know it's here and it's here to stay, it's spread everywhere.As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Sam Senarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050.%

weeks ago and the highs are pretty significant on update so i think we're starting to see a market that is trying to find direction but the direction is much more positive the negative right now uh... yeah it is kind of uh... it's so funny i was just looking at the home builders the home building index which is certainly a laggard in today's market it's down about two percent if you look at the s and p's to be a composite home building index but you know it's been bouncing around a lot and i understand the housing data it feels like it's a little bit more to the downside but the group is still up fifteen percent since october twenty{-}eighth i always feel like there's mixed signals in this market so charlie what do you most monitor forgetting an idea of maybe where valuations should be in where the market will ultimately go because it does sound like you have some optimism for the trade in twenty twenty three and that not only twenty twenty three and and certainly beyond i mean when you think about some of the staggering numbers you know i was just reading today that the bookings institution projects up between twenty twenty twenty thirty about one point six billion people well into the middle class i mean that's that's significant so you think it's a into the middle class in these great companies that will continue to prosper from this growth in our in our economy in our world so it's really not one specific place that i'm looking i'm just looking at the general as a market as a whole that as as we continue to see these numbers improved is just a uh... or an amazing opportunity for the companies across the board really to see increased values at a significant clip okay so charlie i want to go back to fed speakers because we talk about a lot here of course and we try to dissect all of their comments and i'm wondering if you take everyone who you've heard from over the last a few days or so uh... the message that you're seeing is a one that's broadly showing that we're going to see an easing of rate hike come to samber and the early part of twenty twenty three or is it one that says there's still more work to do well i think over the short term there's probably still more work to do and and that's not because of uh... inflation uh... not slowing or slowing down because we are but i think it's really the fed that's trying to be overly aggressive in this market you know what he's done already and i agree with what he's been doing because again a short term bear market is much worse than long term inflation for this economy so i agree with what he's doing but i think now it's time to let all these raises seep into the market and slow down to what i'd love to see him say is that we may have more work to go but we're going to slow down the pace and we're going to wait to see that make that that our increases in in yields are really helping the inflation slow down that's what i'm hoping he says i don't know if you'll save that but i think that would be huge positive indication for the market you know charlie we've talked about this before with you because you and what you do at your firm you specialize in planning for families impacted by autism and you know these are families that really have to make sure that they've got investments in place so i do think in an environment where we feel like things keep coming at us left and right longer term you know what do you see as the best bets yet again it's a really great point and and and i think that you have to take a deep breath as an investor and really measure where you are from a risk tolerance standpoint you know in in the past years is great to own technology but now you have some of those companies down thirty to seventy percent you've lost three to five years of growth in one year or in less than one does that ever come back it will but it's going to lack the rest of the market like it can look like the dot com bust of the late nineties early two thousand and take a decade i mean not not i don't think it's back to some of these companies have real earnings versus and dot com where they had no earnings at all so i think we have companies like amazon that are having a difficult time that will still show some significant earnings moving forward but i do think again you get getting back to point of carl you have to be you have to look at the market and say hey where am i going to get the steadiest growth not get the big ups and downs and i think the steady growth is being brought based not overweating in any industry and the sector and and again i know value is out of favor but again over time value will be more the can the more consistent alright well charlie thank you so much have a good uh... thanksgiving charlie mouse and most senior vp
