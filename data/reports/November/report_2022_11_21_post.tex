I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it.And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15.Yeah, so I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 or for all time bags.I just wanted to learn actually, I'm being surrounded by craftsmen who are making paintings as important.And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years, I think the on{-}shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating.When we're all looking at objectives in terms of carbon, you know, proximity is going to be key.They're delivering locally in a time of global energy turmoil.Utilities historically have been viewed as stodgy, slow moving, boring.The utilities that are going to thrive in this environment are the ones who have a diversified energy mix, particularly the ones who have a higher percent of clean energy resources that is reliable, such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up.Duke Energy, providing regulated gas and electric services to about 10 million customers in seven US states, has flourished in the spotlight.After almost a decade at the helm of finance, Steve Young decided to step away from the role.In September 2022, company veteran Brian Savoy became CFO.%

Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables.The advice I gave him was jump in with all force and make this job as big as you can, because you sit at the nexus of so many things in the Chief Financial Officer role.The company intends to spend a whopping \textbackslash{}\$145 billion in the next decade, with the lion share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid.Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades.I would say yes, there are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past but it feels more systemic that we're going to see inflation for some time higher commodity prices.This is not, or the hour itself, no, it's by the minute and then it'll fall, come back and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid.We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for.A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services.How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back?Now I don't know if all of them are gonna be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company.What they love about selling on Amazon is that they get access to our hundreds and millions of customers, and that completely changes what their prospects can be in terms of the businesses they're building.We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence in ports and to increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time.%

For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance.CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it.As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business.The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals.I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible.I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible.From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future.Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets.So you mentioned the guilt Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like I you know as Barclays You're one of of course the players in selling in buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying like I don't know What happens in the next two hours?So once Brexit happened and you could not pass port financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe.AlphaBets Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start.For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world.%

This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the earth shot council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories.We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation.When and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping No one covers the world like Bloomberg writings on the wall for the bank of England Just stock oil has spray painted the front door session in Europe UK and possibly the US are out in full force celebrating election victory a former president with unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries the moment news breaks 24 hours a day Bloomberg your global business authority Welcome back to the earth shop prize innovation summit finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests including worldwide business leaders philanthropists and non{-}governmental activists now while the 2022 finalists have been announced our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say This is the earth shot decade We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet Some will focus on policy some will focus on activism We are focused on supporting the game changes the innovators the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers We believe in the power of human ingenuity grit and determination To create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet We have only 8\textbackslash{}\% of the ocean protected today and our earth shot is as party said 30 by 30 30\textbackslash{}\% of the ocean at least 30\textbackslash{}\% of the ocean protected by 2030 And we know that if we protect the right 30\textbackslash{}\% not only will prevent the extinction of many marine species But also we will produce more fish there's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the Fortgun catch so we're going to have more fish to eat food security livelihoods for people and we know that for every dollar That we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs So it's a triple win for marine life for food security and for climate and of course for the economy So that's that's the goal the mission to in the next eight years and that's where the air shot is really it's a It's pretty crazy in the next eight years We need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history.There's no choice I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable The work will be difficult.So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature{-}based solution space.And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights, utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon.President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith.The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet.My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change.And while his central task is to create greater value for a chain that now has about 3,000 restaurants, I think I'm really open{-}minded, but I really do want to protect the heritage of Chipotle and make sure that we don't lose the essence.When you're a franchise organization, when you have franchisees that have borrowed to invest in their business, they can't necessarily afford to let inflation eat away at their ability to pay the debt for very long.But for the chain's 45 international restaurants, Bloomberg Intelligence notes that partnering with local operators overseas might boost margins and accelerate expansion.%

From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce, the company has crafted a supply chain carefully over decades.For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis.I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new to Chipotle in last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities.Hard felt and hands on, Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots.That's the application video Tony Shoe and his door dash co{-}founders submitted to get a ticket into why combinators prestigious startup accelerator back in 2013.I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch every day inside school.Yeah, I, you know, it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school, Jack Dorsey and Keith Reward, trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full time.You know, problem one is how do we bring incremental demand to all the physical businesses as they kind of figure out their own digital inhouse capabilities.I still think that the merits behind what, you know, we were trying to do in partnership with the Chow Botics team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build, you know, a cheaper cost product.A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services.How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back?And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud.%

We have worked really hard to open a lot more points of presence and ports and increase our capacity and getting products in, but I think it's going to be something that companies battle with for some time.But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star{-}studded event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame.I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing, if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats.O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image and likeness.He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for antitrust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for gain.And then, on an episode of the shop, surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals.All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture{-}stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples.Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, joiner cursi and Abdelger Bar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow.When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee.I'm gonna feed the people with L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than \textbackslash{}\$13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program.%

Non{-}Pro athletes getting paid for use of their name, image and likeness until last year banned by the NCAA is now allowed and it's changing the face of sports and business radically.Starting her sophomore year, AZ FUD's already signed deals with Chipotle, American Eagle and others, earning tens of thousands of dollars leveraging her on{-}court prowess and off{-}court social media following.In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures that athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools.Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she ain't her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain.AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchored by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, sports strength bio{-}steel, and SC{-}30.The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year, including Lobo, Maya Moore, Twice, Rihanna Stewart, three times, and most recently Paige Becker's, will get to her in a minute.Shooting ads for unreleased at peril isn't something cameras are welcome into, but Aze is also in LA for basketball, getting private workouts with Steph Curry's own trainer, Carl Bergstrom.And as a fellow girl dad, Korea's involvement with an inequality campaign was notable, but not surprising for AZ, who said she was drawn to his brand as much for his off{-}the{-}court persona as his championship pedigree.Korea's also filled a void that AZ and others thought might be left empty after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi died tragically in helicopter crash in 2020.Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring.I wrote that I think they all had very different coats and you had some of that when Leibber Nart talked, but you also had the president of St. Louis Fed say something slightly different as if we would start continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied.That was Henry Blodget talking about the internet and tech on Wall Street way back in June of 2000 when the number one movie in the country was Mission Impossible 2.%

Thursday sees rate decision by Sweden's Rick Spank, economist forecast 75 basis point hike with surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more.And indeed, for example, Governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of the year.I think the challenge they face, David, is that quite frankly, the Fed's record at forecasting inflation has not been very good, including what I was there last year.There might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an issue that took a lot of the big banks, that were limited their participation in the market.And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasury use in reserves in that leverage calculation.The Telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002 wiping out a market cap of \textbackslash{}\$186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison despite his trying to seek protection behind the 5th Amendment.Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank.Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables.As you sit at the nexus of so many things in the Chief Financial Officer role, the business, the regulation, the finance, delivering value to investors and to customers, and I think Brian is very capable of doing that.Duke wants to focus its time, money, and resources on its regulated businesses, and it's looking for a buyer for his commercial renewable energy holdings.Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades.There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're going to see, you know, inflation for some time, higher commodity prices.%

This is not, or the hour it's off now, it's by the minute, and then it'll fall, come back, and we have assets that follow this digitally as well so that we can keep a consistent flow of electrons on the grid.The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries.We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments.Those utilities that have cultivated those relationships in a constructive fashion, where they've been good stewards of capital and operate the system well and took into consideration interest of various stakeholders in addition to the equity and debt investors, of course.For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance.The company's strategic plan recognized e{-}commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation.The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bonn Airport, designing it around key strategic goals.We own the biggest chunk of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term visas and visit growth in our business we anticipate that the people keep going.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were dark suits and white shirts and look alike, right?From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future.It was about doubling down in the UK where we want to be a leading financial institution in sort of everything, retail and wholesale and it is about building up a very specialized consumer business in the US which we've done.%

That's the application video Tony Xu and his door dash co{-}founders submitted to get a ticket into why combinators prestigious startup accelerator back in 2013.I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch you know every day inside school.The second thing was really just the power of independent thinking you know my parents because they were so busy just trying to make a life for our family that I was largely left alone.Yeah I you know it was it was actually a pretty stiff competition between finishing school Jack Dorsey and Keith were trying to convince me to leave Stanford and work at Square full{-}time.I mean we were talking about thousands of dollars per week which is you know the difference sometimes between making payroll and and actually you know surviving and they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon and frankly a necessary one and that really became you know the impetus to start Dorash.New businesses overseas, you know, we announced a large acquisition in Volt, where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people.Well, I don't know if it's going to get applied directly, you know, to food or to delivery, I mean, I think, you know, it absolutely has the potential to create a new economic infrastructure Right?An economic infrastructure that can really serve as the basis for new banking systems and et cetera And so I think that's something more that's tangential to the world of delivery Obviously payments is one part of what we do, but it's not the central thing So we're going to do a little rapid fire now a little quicker, fun, questions, favorite food I've ordered from 1100 different DoorDash restaurants Wow So I actually like to try everything Your business idol There are people in retail that I've admired, you know, the people that founded everything from Walmart to Costco The team in Amazon, you know, in e{-}commerce, the team Elon Musk and what he's trying to do What about Elon Musk by Twitter?When I sat down with him ahead of the World Cup, I wanted to ask him about concerns to do with Qatar's human rights record, the lights of David Beckham doing deals with the state and why footballers can never win.Well I think it's really interesting isn't it because the minute players stand up and voice their concerns everyone sells them, stay out of politics, stick to football.Many footballers, as you've become pundits and bastards, journalists, commentators, there has also been criticism of, for instance, David Beckett becoming a paid ambassador to Qatar ahead of the World Cup.Native Channels shopBoy Ke  Vik Welcome To Daveryk Australia Welcome to Vik photography becomes a huge story the incredible good that they do for the local communities visiting kids in hospital loads of good things raising awareness of whether it be racism or during the COVID pandemic that doesn't become the big story but what you know one player goes out and a drunk and a night out and gets pictured with a girl or something then that becomes like a front page story and it's and it's a little bit unfair and that doesn't really happen as much in other areas it's a disproportionate I think it's disproportionate I mean of course when acts as you know, behave badly or things it also gets captured but it's interesting to hear you think it is disproportionate I mean we should also say there have been some really high profile cases and allegations made against top glass for all of us in relation to behaviour with women on the surface it seems a change in the culture when you were playing around the game I don't know if that's fair and what you think about that I don't know I still think when I played I doubt it's that much different now you'd have there's a lot more money I suppose and there is a lot not a lot of people not settling down there's a lot more money and there'd be a lot more you know, dangers and outside interests I honestly think that mostly though like the massive majority of football has to be really good lads well behaved work really really hard on what they do and live properly because you have to now because it's so competitive and I think it was exactly the same in my day you will still get the odd drunk the odd sexist the odd homophobic person they are like a cross{-}section of a%

Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the earth shot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade.I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages.We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation.And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our Earthshot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult.So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature{-}based solution space.And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo{-}mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon.President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith.The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet.My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F.

Alphabet Sundart Pachai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start.For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation.A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars.That's the application video Tony Shoe and his door dash co{-}founders submitted to get a ticket into why combinators prestigious startup accelerator back in 2013.But the big question facing companies now is how to navigate a potentially prolonged economic downturn joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, door dash CEO and co{-}founder Tony Shoe.I didn't understand what it meant to live off of food stamps to buy groceries or free and reduced lunch you know every day inside school.So how did the idea for DoorDash come about and the decision to not work for, you know, Jack Dorsey in Square, which I'm sure was also kind of intoxicating, right?I mean, we were talking about thousands of dollars per week, which is, you know, the difference sometimes between making payroll and actually, you know, surviving, and they would just turn them down because they were delivery orders, which to us was a really novel and unfortunate phenomenon and, frankly, a necessary one.I mean, I mean, it's early days I know Elon Musk has said, starting a company is like swallowing glass and staring into the abyss of death.You know, just robot stuff, a lot of chess I was practicing for you, I know you're pretty good I don't like that I will take this Put it over here Not cool, not cool Alright, I will, I will concede I can see you've got me, Bid Very good game, well played Thank you, sir, thank you No one covers the world like Bloomberg The writings on the wall for the bank of England Just stock oil has spray paints at the front door Session in Europe, UK and possibly the US We are out in full force celebrating the election victory of former president Blula With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day Bloomberg, your global business authority DoorDash went public, middle of the pandemic And I remember actually you were coming on Bloomberg and the price doubled at the opening Obviously, terrible economic times, the depths of the pandemic What did that feel like when you're going out into the world starting to sell to public investors And the price just doubles It was certainly very exciting, it was exhilarating It was the first time that our company went public The first time that I had ever undergone any of those types of experiences before But in the back of my head it was that saying that you're never as good or as bad as they say you are And so just remember that So tease that out for me a little bit because the big question is how much do customers keep ordering out in a high inflation environment How much long{-}term sustainability and growth is there really Even though COVID is now effectively sustained and we understand how to live with it Customers are continuing to order Those that join us during the pandemic they're still ordering out about the same rights as those who joined us before the pandemic And that's because eating out and getting things delivered are pretty complimentary On the second point around inflation, you know I can say that in the last 60 years in looking at the data Spend in restaurants and in grocery have only declined in two of those 60 years including high inflationary times Much higher than what we observed today And so what I think I take you know, solace in even though I see the fact that there is high inflation Is that customers are going to continue spending on food and our job is to bring greater and greater affordability More broadly the economy isn't a tough position Your competitors have announced layoffs and hiring freezes and slowdowns is door dash considering any of these I think we've been fortunate mostly because most of our investments that happened during the pandemic Really were meant to build new businesses And those new businesses have continued to grow new business is you know beyond restaurants And categories like grocery convenience or retail new businesses overseas you know we announced a large acquisition Involved where that really helped double our overall addressable market to 700 million people New businesses and building and advertising%

I still think that the merits behind what we were trying to do in partnership with the chowbottix team was the right idea in which we can help restaurants effectively build a cheaper cost product.But look, I think you're writing, calling out that when I look around me, I want to look at especially public company founders, CEOs, well, hey, there aren't that many, B, when you start filtering for those from Asian descent.Don't think that, however, it's quite acceptable that maybe they like Western Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the transactions and the technology.Hardcore boxing fans who are the beating heart of the sport are a small minority versus a potential audience for a YouTube fight between KSI and Logan Paul.How do you weigh that up between growing globally with Canelo, for example, versus retaining that mom and pop, UK family run feel of this business?And probably, it's only in the last year or so, he started to understand my ambition of, we can't be that family business and move globally in the way and with the speed that I want to.Recently Eddie Herndt promoted the fight between the Irish Boxer Katie Taylor and the Puerto Rican fighter Amanda Serrano.Women's boxing obviously through April 30th at Madison Square Garden has changed forever and actually it's quite funny because I'm negotiating a fight at the moment.So the high end, the elite level of women's boxing is incredible KT Taylor Sorano but there are, you know, in the male side of the sport, you know, you could make 10 great fights in the division in women's boxing maybe it's just one fight in the division but that's changing because these individuals are setting the standard, raising the bar, you know, paving the way for young female fighters to actually have a big future within the sport.I think that we have an obligation to our fighters to maximize their earnings and their revenue in a very dangerous sport and I don't want to lean on PGA Tour Formula One, WWE but these are organizations that are hard for me to say this.Well I think it would be the ability to make the biggest fights possible in the sport and the problem with boxing versus UFC for example is you know you have different broadcasters you have different promoters.Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel couldn't find much to hope for, Mr. Trump's candidacy.%

Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years.And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater, if they are affected by droughts and by floods.Well, and just picking up on that on the investments in it, Bob, I want to come back to you, because one of the things that I'm taking away from COP27, you can certainly hear, listen to John Kerry, the president's special envoy on this subject.Thursday, C's week decision by Sweden's Riksbank, economist forecast 75 basis point hike, but surging food prices could tip the bank to raise by even more.A handful of earnings next week to watch, including Zoom video, deer, analog devices, best buy, and Nordstrom, keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the U.S. begins on Friday.And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, lapsed that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation.And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India helped drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism?I think we need to remain aware that in the original vote in the UN General Assembly, there were countries with more than half of the world's population who abstained onto the Russia side, who declined to join in condemning.The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of \textbackslash{}\$186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Evers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment.Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot, which was an instant market hit when it went public, and just as quickly went flop.Some of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader, and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman freed.And the moment it was forced into bankruptcy, it made one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank.%

Is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement that you think could end this war in the next few months or so?And I think on all of the major issues, whether it's Russia or China or Iran, you'll see the same kind of deep consultation and engagement between the two countries that you've seen before, regardless of who's President, regardless of who's Prime Minister.Second, it was a UN mediator working with our U.S. envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.I mean, the United States does need to acknowledge that we have our own difficulties and challenges within our own democracy, even as we tout and promote democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights around the world.You were elected as a road scholar and from Oxford, you later came back and went to Yale Law School and you were a top{-}editor there and became a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Breyer.And then we also bring in other cabinet members, depending on what the subjects are being briefed, so that the president gets exposure to his full national security team over the course of the week.So when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the secretary of state, side{-}vants, and the national advisor is a big brazen ski.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.And I think Ukraine is in a position now today to ensure that they will remain a strong sovereign viable independent state, even as they continue to try to resist Russian aggression on a portion of their territory.She dove deep and became a crypto convert swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase making the first female general partner at venture firm and recent horror wits.However, I think what happened is you had in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, you know, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do.One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle.%

Was there a moment where you were in the office thinking like, as Barclays, you're one of the players in selling and buying guilds with the margin calls coming in and saying, I don't know what happens in the next two hours?So once Brexit happened and you could not pass support financial services to London, all the major banks had to set up trading enterprises in Europe.As we go through our PhD with general coding, our repeatedly experienced solution supplies and compost for environmental cost 000 billion, putting 20 million gemcapers in the public week, taking a whole seemed installation on how to obtain more memory{-}cost information.Music When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis.Particularly the ones who have a higher percentage of clean energy resources that is reliable, such as nuclear, as well as wind and solar and gas in the mix to back those up.Aiming to retire all coal by 2035, achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and reshape its portfolio around natural gas, nuclear power and renewables.So our plan is to reduce natural gas over time, but use it as a bridge fuel as we proliferate renewables and nuclear has been just a tremendous benefit for our customers.Newquants to focus its time, money and resources on its regulated businesses and it's looking for a buyer for its commercial renewable energy holdings.The company intends to spend a whopping \textbackslash{}\$145 billion in the next decade, where the lion share going to changing its energy mix and modernizing its grid.Brian Savoy is in charge of deploying this capital under highly challenging conditions, including the highest inflation and most volatile energy prices in decades.There are a lot of pressures on the business that we might have had in short spells in the past, but it feels more systemic that we're going to see, inflation for some time, higher commodity prices.The operators in this room can respond to incoming data with immediate action, remotely controlling wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries.%

We're seeing more of it, more frequency of severe events and how we predict those, monitor those, and estimate the damage using data analytics and machine learning to say, how many customers might be out of this happens, what generators are at risk, and all that modeling goes into our planning for what we put our investments.So instead of a patchwork of different tax credits that we've seen in the past, it actually creates a light path going well into 2030s for this long term transition on the grid.There's been criticisms, say, in Europe that they were trying to go too fast into renewables, for example, and therefore they left out nuclear and they sort of shuttered coal plants and now they're paying the price in that respect.But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaugh and Jennifer Pondstadt who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh.Hoping that the economy will be able to move forward  We've done a lot, but we have additional work to do, both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down.To help us sort it all out, we welcome now a sunny, bachelor CEO of Rock Creek and Bob Michael, his chief investment officer and head of the Global Fixed Income Unit at JP Morgan Asset Management.Every wealth management platform in JP Morgan, every institutional client, they're coming to us, they're putting money in bonds, they're looking to commit more, and they haven't done so for years.And the most important part of the discussion this time, David, has been the fact that developing countries, again, have felt that they are in some cases suffering because if they're an island economy, they're going underwater.And meanwhile Taiwan that holds midterms this coming weekend so that's going to be a polls check on the popularity of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as of course we see geopolitical tensions continue to rise in the region.The chair Jerome Powell said then that US interest rates would go higher than earlier projected but several Fed members since have indicated that they may be ready to downshift.A handful of earnings next week to watch including Zoom video, deer and a log devices best by and Nordstrom keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the US begins on Friday.The main theme to watch there will be the flight to discounted items by cash strap consumers that seem willing to spend but maybe not have the same capacity as they did a year ago.%

Another might be actually to ameliorating at least some of the restrictions in regulation and repose after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, which really is an idea to took a lot of the big banks, and it limited their participation in the market.Central Bank and policymakers agreed that it made sense to have a supplementary leverage ratio that typically would not be binding most of the time, but it could prevent, if you will, financial institutions from gaming and entirely risk{-}based system.Larry, you and I talk a lot about monetary policy, even fiscal stimulus and things, but geopolitics have also factored increasingly and some of the issues having to do with the economy.And the reporting behind the scenes are that some of the developing countries like Indonesia and India help drive that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism?Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank.Through a confluence of inspiration and perspiration, in no time he'd find himself in this  Kenny Beats was a music obsessed team who already played multiple instruments when he finally picked up an NPC.Through a confluence of inspiration and perspiration, in no time he'd find himself in the studio with major artists, attending one of the most prestigious music schools and even blowing up as an EDM DJ, all before he would re{-}emerge back in hip{-}hop, carving his own lane.His fluidity as a producer has allowed him to work across multiple genres and collaborate with everyone from Doja Cat to Freddie Gibbs, and through his beloved YouTube series The Cave, at a massive footprint on Discord and Twitch, he's created a uniquely interactive digital community, and it all started with one idea.My godfather, my dad's best friend, took me to mannies in the city on 48th, bought me a guitar, took me to Michael Jordan's stay{-}couse and grand central while we stay.Following a commitment to his parents to pursue higher education, he left behind the connections he had forged in New York and headed to the Berkeley College of Music in Boston.On the back of Kenny's musical virtuosity and Ryan's deep connections to the scene, the group found near immediate success, booking prominent remixes and hundreds of live shows.And I just tried to re{-}educate myself, and a lot of the time it's me who's co{-}produced with Skrillex and done all this big boy stuff, learning from a 17{-}year{-}old who doesn't know how to do like the most basic thing in production, but they are the sound right now.%

And basically the idea is all the people who are watching you stream all the time and are really interested in that community or the cave, this would be like a place for them to go, 24{-}7, and maybe they could start their own little shows or little things together, collaborate or whatever.Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring.Rosenblatt's hope was that you could feed a neural network a bunch of data like pictures of men and women, and it would eventually learn how to tell them apart, just like humans do.The arrival of super fast chips and the massive amounts of data produced on the internet gave Hinton's algorithms a magical boost.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.Is there any chance of a resolution in Ukraine matter any time in the foreseeable future, any possibility of a truce or some kind of agreement that you think could end this war in the next few months or so?Second, it was a UN mediator working with our US envoy, the Saudis, Emirates, and the Yemenis, who helped produce earlier this year a ceasefire in the war in Yemen, which had been the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.I mean, the United States does need to acknowledge that we have our own difficulties and challenges within our own democracy, even as we tout and promote democratic institutions, rule of law, human rights around the world.You must have done reasonably well, you were elected as a Rhodes Scholar and from Oxford you later came back and went to Yale Law School and you were a top{-}editor there and became a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Breyer.So when I work in the White House under President Carter, there were frequent disputes between the Secretary of State, Sy Vance, and the National Security Advisor as a big brazen ski.In terms of their disturbance of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, actions that they are taking with their military to undermine peace and stability, the American position has remained steadfast and consistent.In hindsight, which is always 2020, is there anything the administration could have done to prevent Putin from invading or told the allies more forcefully that this invasion was going to occur to convince them because it seemed as if they didn't really believe it was going to happen?%

things just might start to move in a better direction in US{-}China relations After a President Biden's meeting in Bali with President Xi I absolutely believe there's need not be a new Cold War I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all Hoping that inflation may just be easing a bit in the United States With Fed Vice Chair Leo Brainer telling Bloomberg We might see a bit of moderation in rate hikes I think it will probably be appropriate to move to a slower pace of increases But I think what's really important to emphasize, we've done a lot But we have additional work to do both on raising rates and sustaining restraint to bring inflation down Hoping that the new British government has gotten the message As it put forth a new budget designed to reassure the markets So today we deliver a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy Our priorities are stability, growth and public services And then of course there's that special kind of hope the former President Trump brings to everything he does Deciding that despite what happened in the midterms to his hand{-}picked candidates This was the right time to announce he's running again for President In order to make America great and glorious again I am tonight announcing my candidacy for President of the United States Even as prominent investor and Republican supporter Ken Griffin of Citadel Couldn't find much to hope for in Mr. Trump's candidacy He lost in 2020 We lost Georgia because of his behavior in the Senate race in 2020 That's the second loss And then this year the Republicans lost the Senate because the Trump{-}backed candidates in the Senate races were rejected by American voters That's a three{-}time loser And I'd like to think that the Republican party's ready to move on from somebody who's been for this party a three{-}time loser But whatever we were all hoping for this week we didn't really get that much out of the markets Which traded without real conviction with the S\textbackslash{}\&P 500 off just 7 tens of a percent for the week And the Nasdaq down 1.57 percent And the yield on the 10 year up about 7 basis points in the week at 3.82 To help us sort it all out we welcome now a sunny bachelor CEO of Rock  point five seven percent and the yield on the ten year up about seven basis points ending the week at three point eight two to help us sort of all out welcome now a sunny best of us CEO of rock creek and bob michael he's chief investment officer and head of the global fixed income unit at jp more than asset management so welcome both you great to have you back but let me start with you i mean i watched the eco numbers i listened to the feds big i sort of felt like i was going both ways at the same time what did you see well for a bond investor all of us who have been battered this year this is one of the weeks that made sense to us we had a nice tailwind coming in from the inflation data it was great all the way through core when you look at shelter everything yes the markets went a little crazy they went while and the central bankers did what they're supposed to do they came in one by one and reminded us don't declare victory yet these are only a couple prints there are more hikes to come but maybe there is some optimism and the market settled down so i look at this week and i thought this is the first great week in a long time so if sonny is that the way you saw it as well and there's still some more rage hikes to come how many i think at least another three to start with 50 basis points next time in December followed by at least two or three 25 basis points next year and then we'll see from there and i think what Bob said is very true at the same time as we were listening to at least three fed people come and speak i wrote down i think they all had i wrote down i think they all had very different coats and you had some of that when labor not talked but you also had the president of saint Louis fed say something slightly different as if you know we would start continue we would continue with rate increases for a while longer than she had implied and then of course we had Susan Collins coming today with even you know sort of potential 75 basis points so we're hearing numbers that are a little bit all over the place and trying to make sense of it so Bob the market's making it harder for the fed as a practical matter um they were at the start of the week i think not so much now i think we're all in the same spot we've all got realistic expectations the fed's headed to four and a half five percent they'll get there sometime in the first quarter we'll see where inflation is if it's below the fed funds rate then that gives them some scope to pause on the tightening we can reevaluate at that point but right now bon yields have gone up a long way in a very short period of time it's time for a breath Bob does that get us to a soft landing?%

I Think as said what is very interesting right now is even in any Foundation or endowment or the assets that we manage You're finding the exactly the same phenomena where people had moved away from bonds and cash and we're all equities and and private investments moving back into holding bonds and as we're sort of reaching that 4.5 percent that Bob talked about Much more interest in bonds in a more balanced kind of portfolio and of course people are looking at cash with 4 percent With treasury bills at the level that is much higher than cash was earned in a very long time But I think the bigger thing that is happening in the portfolios we're looking at is obviously a lot of Investors institution investors have been also investing in venture private equity Real estate in private form and I think that is going to some sort of transformation too Well, let's let's take a segue if we could from that sort of investment in the COP27 As we're speaking right now it's still going to end on Saturday right now of sunny you know far better than I do It looks like it's going to be difficult for them to get to the objectives that they had You're absolutely right so far as we know Tonight the latest news was not too positive.Not things could change tomorrow morning But they didn't really have anything major to announce again as you remember remember in COP26 they had the G{-}Fans which was A large number of large asset managers signing up to make pretty significant shifts in their carbon print but Most recently they started walking back from that or not wanting to sign quite on what they had agreed to into in COP26 So I think it's very very important as we're having these meetings Maybe they shouldn't be every year Maybe they should be every other year or less often but show some sort of progress and the most important part of the discussion this time David Has been a fact that developing countries again have felt that they are in some cases Suffering because if they're an island economy they're going underwater if they are affected by by droughts and by floods A lot of it might be caused by those who did use a lot of carbon over the last ten twenty years and they're asking if they could get help and That help is really not coming and I think that is the really major Summary of COP27 which is that the expectations of Investments into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the COP What and just pick about that on the investments in it Bob I want to come back to you because I want to think at least I'm taking away from COP  into climate are probably less than what we expected going into the cop.Bob, last word, are you seeing a difference in your part of the business for the government tax policy when it comes to green bonds?Keep an eye on those last two for a read on the strength of the consumer as the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season in the US begins on Friday.While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today went electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.That's restrictive enough It's an excellent point because Typically monetary policy op does operate with a lag so the Fed wants to look ahead and indeed For example governor Waller and others have made reference to comparing the policy rate to where Professional forecasters think inflation will be towards the end of of the year And I appreciate that point my own research actually indicates that's a simple thing to do I think the challenge they face David is that quite frankly the Fed's record at forecasting inflation Has not been very good including what I was there Last year and so I think it's going to be a balance between Adjusting policy according to both the forecast and the incoming data Richard is not just the rates that are going on We also have so{-}called quantitative tightening as you try to run down the balance sheet which had gone so far up Give us your sense of what that is doing right now to financial conditions in the United States Well, David it is tightening conditions again quantitative tightening is is reversing quantitative easing So the Fed's balance sheet is shrinking now.And the Fed indicated when it left those exemptions, laps that it would begin, it would review whether or not it made sense to include treasuries and reserves in that leverage calculation.And the reporting behind the scenes are, is that some of the developing countries, like Indonesia and India, help provide that process, which might, I don't want to overread it, suggest that maybe we're taking a half step back toward multilateralism?The telecommunications phenom of the late 90s that followed Enron into bankruptcy in 2002, wiping out a market cap of \textbackslash{}\$186 billion and sending its former CEO Bernie Ebers to prison, despite his trying to seek protection behind the Fifth Amendment.Or that emblem of the first internet bubble, pets.com with that cute sock puppet mascot, which was an instant market hit when it went public, and just as quickly went flop.All of these notorious failures shared a bold vision, a confident leader, and a belief that they'd come up with a better mouse trap, just like Mr. Bankman Fried.Lehman was forced into bankruptcy amid one of the most turbulent periods in our economic history, which culminated in a catastrophic crisis of confidence and a run on the bank.%
