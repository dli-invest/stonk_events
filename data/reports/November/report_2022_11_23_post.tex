I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink.And then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody would go and watch it.By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand.And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over \textbackslash{}\$10 billion in retail sales worldwide.The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here.And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals.And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos.For MGA actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity.In late 2015, Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay \textbackslash{}\$3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loopsy dolls.But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to.Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment.So dad buys their forces to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon, let's find another way to reach children.%

When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's world to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away.I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another.With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars.Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems.If you've seen sci{-}fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so exorbitant and expensive you would never be able to build in the first place.The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer, made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth.Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs.A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door.I got married and I have a child, so you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living in the city and then move out to the suburbs, we have a kid and a wife.Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent.Heather, having bought her fixer{-}up or site{-}on{-}scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment.This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers.%

In some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers.On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Corey, and John Fitch attached to the suit.A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well.And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50\textbackslash{}\% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing.The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure.A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones.Equipped with two multi{-}beam sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometres of the sea floor.You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics that is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship.That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance.We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soy and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in.So of the course, and that's five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat.What's called artificial meat the realest fake{-}est burger in the world Not bad But before impossible foods can take over the world It's going to have to overcome strong competitors penetrate tough new markets and generally transform its product from a Conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down This could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream In Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown a long{-}time vegan was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry I've been assigned just my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is What makes me delicious Pat Brown someone call a zealot for his mission He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture producing Meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change and we have to find a better way to produce meat You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatchlance their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas Mefane in fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15\textbackslash{}\% of all greenhouse gas emissions Impossible claims it takes 89\textbackslash{}\% less G.H.G's 87\textbackslash{}\% less water and 96\textbackslash{}\% less land to produce its burger The key of course would be to get people to actually eat the thing which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in Heem a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron rich taste like red meat So heem is a very controversial part of the impossible burger It's also what makes the impossible burger what it is There are a lot of consumer groups and anti{-}GMO groups that oppose the impossible burger because of the heem The studies on its safety are pretty short{-}term but the FDA has approved it and the company says it's completely safe and There isn't any evidence that it isn't Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat Pointing out that while the impossible burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin It's also more highly processed But let's be real.%

CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship.The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red.The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development.In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names.Other open world games felt empty and forced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions.Before it was very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous cyberpunk world, they saw over 8 million pre{-}orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre{-}sell.So Marchinevinsky, who is a co{-}founder and co{-}CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project.The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies.North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding, it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home.So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports coal basically a symmetrical weapons.Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism.Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs.%

pers President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state.When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people.MUSIC In 1968, Avant{-}Schumard and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina.It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion.Ivana had this model where he was basically saying, you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community.As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over \textbackslash{}\$1 billion in 2017.So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office.As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self{-}driving cars, why can't you fix this now?So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long{-}term growth, is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack, rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top.Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans?I don't need to over dramatize what it was but that's what it felt like at the time and that level of pride I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it, I get the mom guilt, I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently but I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about.You know it's fascinating to, was I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot and I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and it is video going to be the first, the way they understand it's going to be about, you know, search is going to be a different type of experience so much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation.%

Has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health?That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me.Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day.You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion.You mentioned if done correctly and there are concerns there are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers.The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology and when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online.Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau.Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers.But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being a highly performant.Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias.So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling a delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS.I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users.%

It's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice.In terms of the broader picture today, we are still seeing the CSI 300 clinging on to gains as we are for the likes of Japan as well, India just online in the last hour or so.Steve, let's flesh that out a bit in terms of the key data that is going to drive the OPEC plus decision{-}making come December, what do investors need to look out for and how could it make a meaningful shift?Now, Bloomberg has learned that digital asset brokerage Genesis is struggling to raise fresh cash for its lending unit and is warning potential investors that may need to file for bankruptcy.So in the ongoing FTX, yes, so Bloomberg has learned that crypto investment firm, Genesis is struggling to raise funds for its lending arm.This comes after we learned last week that BlockFi, a crypto lending firm as well, which was earlier bailed out by FTX may again be in the process of filing a bankruptcy as well.And I can't imagine anybody being surprised by this because if you look at his tweets and if you were to divide it up in ratios, before most of it will be dedicated around SpaceX and Tesla, now you add Twitter into the mix and his concentration is focused as a time is arguably not as readily available as it was before.Twitter has lost almost 5,000 employees since Elon took over and he plans to fire more sales staff and it's our title on Austria is a hard core part.The US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has met with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Feng, on the sidelines of the Nazi and Summit in Cambodia.The US says Austin urged China to fully enforce sanctions against North Korea and avoid quote destabilizing acts toward Taiwan.Seven European football teams have decided against wearing rainbow on bands at the World Cup to show solidarity with the LGBTQ rights.The decision follows pressure from the sports governing body FIFA, which suggested referees would yellow card players for the show of support.%

The Middle East certainly looks attractive and we've had a blockbuster IPO in America on a recently, and the market's rotating to obviously very high oil prices, which looks a good diversifier to us.A taxis regulator is investigating celebrities including sports stars Tom Brady, staff carry over potential securities law violations tied to the promotion of the crypto exchange FTX.Fresh turmoil for cryptos, digital asset brokerage, genesis struggles to raise cash for its lending unit, wars it may need to file for bankruptcy.So this really comes down to one of the signature policy drives from the president Dan Xi Jinping, which is common prosperity use F. And then briefly, can you run us through the deadline that Malaysia is facing to name a new prime minister?They weren't expecting other coalitions or major parties, BN and PH to give up so much ground, but essentially a PN lead government would maintain a populist slant.They're on a stick with Malaysia's election for a moment, the uncertainty there that is dragging on with their country's longest ruling coalition yet to announce which faction it will support informing a new government.It's interesting too that the police chief of Malaysia has really warned against social media being used to promote hate speech if we continue to see a political gridlock here.So I think we're in pretty good shape to weather whatever the recession throws at us, but obviously I think at the moment demand is so strong, there's some shortages on the supply side as airlines have rationalised their fleet.I mean, Musk has been certainly preoccupied by his newly acquired social media platform, tweeting at all hours, leading some investors to worry that Tesla's strategy may have sort of fallen by the wayside.Well, we first had is we had the journal report that Saudi Arabia was gonna add oil back to the market, potentially with an OPEC plus increasing supply in their next decision by 500,000 barrels a day.Also, the development as well that we mentioned, Manus, around the DOJ, at least regulators, officials in the U.S. and New York, I believe, who had in the months previous to this fallout and collapse of FTX actually started probing the business.I mean, when I spoke to her, and this will leave a lot of people saying, you know, scratching their heads, she reiterated their call that ultimately Bitcoin can get to a million dollars per coin.%

Cooling coming also beginning of December and this will leave a bit more leeway for the fat to act So here I think the fat will actually pause starting in January so they will probably hike in December But after that they will rather digest the cooling inflation figures and trade a bit longer So we will have higher rates for longer But the positive here is this will be much more digestible for equity valuations because it's also on the same time becoming more predictable less data dependent That's a big call Stephanie that they're going to pause after a December hike does that suggest it sounds like you would push back on on Kalanavitches call that you need to see a cut before you're going to see any sustained rally in risk assets Yes, actually I really think that the the the inflation figures are cooling and there will be some basic facts So actually the fat will still be committed to taming inflation But they will probably take more time so they will they will rise rate rates over longer period and not not in a hurry So you've decided to to join BlackRock and the chorus in terms of wanting to get on the credit bus Where am I sufficiently compensated to get on board the credit bus So I think fixed income investors right now are not well compensated by taking on additional risks First of all in years investment rate corpus you currently earn a year towards around 5\textbackslash{}\% which is even above the current earning yield of the S\textbackslash{}\&P So here that's actually true alternative for equities on top you don't really see a get a pickup towards emerging markets If you look at investment rate emerging market uh spreads usually they were trading as with a pickup to investment grade corpus but right now this pickup really has disappeared So I think right now really investors should stay focused on US and also your investment grade corpus Stephanie if you were to push out into high yields Where would you where would you be looking within this environment I think energy really offers rising stars so actually currently um as we have recessionary pressures we favor defensive sectors with stable cash flows such as talcos but also health care companies Um we are underweight cyclicals and that's what is interesting so energy had historically been a very cyclical sector High bidder sector but today energy is really offering stable cash flows um cash rich companies are strong uh fundamentals So here we are really keen on adding opportunities to our good full use Also currently oil price is absolutely elevated but still if oil prices are starting to fall let's say back to 60 um US dollar per barrel we still think that companies can continue to operate profitable in this environment Um I think a lot would have to go wrong in the world to get us to 60 bucks I'd be very worried of oil is at 60 dollars.Bob Iger, straight back to business after making his surprise return as CEO of Disney, taking the first steps to reshape the media giant.Plus, keeping the lid on, oil whipsaws of Saudi Arabia denies a report saying OPEC Plus is weighing a production increase at its December meeting.I know the headlines about the rapid reserve losses, but broadly speaking, most central banks in the region still have ample ammunition here, but it's all about ensuring financial stability, not preventing effects depreciation at all cost.Remember that this is an economy that continues to attract enormous amounts of foreign direct investment into manufacturing, joining the regional supply chains.The concerns are that Genesis and other crypto outlets such as BlockFi are pretty much unnerving the investor community on the back of some bankman freeds FTX empire imploding that you've got to sell off in Bitcoin.You know, you saw the oil prices jump back up after they rebutted the Wall Street Journal report that they were considering a OPEC plus 500,000 barrels a day increase in their meeting in December.The feds Mary Daley warns about the lag effects of rate highs while the RETAMASTER says 75 basis points isn't needed next month.Ladies call for a rethink of immigration laws while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denies seeking a Swiss style relationship with Europe.Parm oil actually moving higher up by 3.2 percent in fact in today's session that as a result of increased production and also concerns around strong shipments.Reports suggest at least 162 lives have been lost with hundreds more injured after the magnitude 5.6 quake struck the West Java region of Monday afternoon.Elon Musk has laid off more Twitter workers from the sales side of the business further trimming as staff already diminished by cuts and resignations.%

Stu speaks was on the program, coming up, we'll continue some of these conversations with Anna Stupmanska, who joins us, Fidelity International Global Macro economist, just what are the prospects for recession in the United States next year?And just because you brought it up, I would point everyone watching and listening to the big take story on the Bloomberg and online today, which talks about the housing market in Canada and how it is defleating in a very material ray.In terms of the PBOC or I mean, yeah, of course, for the ECB or the Federal Reserve who wants to see inflation get down, China demand coming back and boosting commodity prices as a result seems like it would make that job a lot harder.Of course, if we see a really big bounce in China growth and demand coming back, that would boost inflation and that would spill over to the rest of the world.Well, to that point, Anna, we have heard from central bankers, regional Fed presidents for the Federal Reserve, for example, continuing to reiterate that message.South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, will be meeting with King Charles III on his first day of his state visit in the UK.I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue.And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world.Robin Wiggles worth in the financial times publishing an hour ago, a brilliant sum of this quoting at length, Sinali Bassic, and our crypto team reporting on Genesis.Louberg's learned the firm is struggling to attract funding for its lending unit, which suspended withdrawals after the collapse of FTX.Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets.I don't want to spread rumors, but we've talked about it on this show before that perhaps certain institutions are so entrenched in this asset class that they have a vested interest in not mass selling and in trying to keep things afloat and finding an entry point.%

Elvaro, when Bloomberg surveillance visits you at Central Portugal for the ECB con FAB here next year, you're modeling out 6 percent global inflation.With your academics and particularly teaching at the University of British Columbia, how do you respond to a central banker gaining out a two{-}year recession as we got from the governor of the bank of England?And it's all these institutions, and you know, I go back to the world trade organization where you wouldn't expect this analysis, and they were really leading on global slowdown, maybe with a Pacific Rim view, and you get the same thing from OECD.Mary Daly of San Francisco can't say enough about it there with some real tourist comments here about the social consequences of how the Fed dances to December 14th and in the next year as well.But yeah, the hope that they will eventually open up, we'll see what we saw in Europe and America where pent up demand for going out, eating out restaurants, things that you couldn't do in lockdown.I mean, I look, I remember I did a whole thing on rice for Bloomberg on the economy, Lisa years ago, and it was the cost of food in America.I mean, this is the question, if we don't necessarily get some sort of increase in the production of oil, what does rate hikes do other than make it more difficult for people who are at the lowest deciles of their income sphere to be able to afford it?And what's interesting here is that the rare optimistic call, there are people out there looking for a constructive 2023, but just up against OECD this morning, folks, and all you need to know is the migration on real GDP growth is a bank of England like.Tracy Mcmillian is in charge of basics at Wells Fargo Investment Institute is head of global asset allocation strategy.In China, an increase in COVID cases has led local authorities into reintroducing measures like expanding testing and lockdowns.To improve your firm's productivity and profitability, Bloomberg law combines the latest in AI{-}powered tools and in depth analysis to accelerate the research process.Now, what the authorities are trying to do is they're trying to thread this needle up about not enforcing mass widespread lockdowns that we saw saying Shanghai earlier in the year, but they're trying to do more targeted restrictions on the ground.%

Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine instructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets.To improve your firm's productivity and profitability, Bloomberg law combines the latest and AI{-}powered tools and in{-}depth analysis to accelerate the research process.And I do want to bring this to you because I've seen a slew of notes and concern about this huge railway strike as they're the standoff kind of hardens with the Biden administrations outreach to them.There's concern in policy circles that even you're going to start to see pressures in these these marketplaces and ripple effects, even before stopages and you have lots of folks around the country who are traveling, not to mention the goods and Christmas time and everything else that comes out of it.There's a law called the Railway Labor Act and that lets Congress come in to either impose a resolution based on what the president's emergency board submitted.And that lets Congress come in to either impose a resolution based on what the president's emergency board submitted this past summer or to basically punt and kick the can down the road to require operations as is for say three or six months.Earlier in the year we talked a lot about the shift in power to labor, to the worker, to basically be able to demand higher pay, especially in light of the inflation.From your vantage point, politically, is there also less willingness to allow labor to sort of cane the upper hand at a time when economic growth and frankly the mix of Congress has changed?If they can't find the money they need, they are still talking to folks across Wall Street who are getting a very intimate view into what the balance sheet looks like.What's the oxygen between stable coins and things that were more established and used for some sort of substitute fiat currency and Bitcoin and some of the other crypto assets that don't have the same kind of ballast?Really, I'm curious how much people are looking to China as sort of the peripheral deciding factor to your point earlier, Tom, not only with oil prices, but also global growth.I don't actually I think that we're going to see inflation come down in the first half of next year pretty quickly For reasons that may not have anything to do with what the feds up to we're seeing goods price deflation It's about as powerful as we've ever seen we're seeing energy prices potentially also food prices starting to roll over So if those things that are sort of Around the periphery of what the feds able to control start to cause inflation to moderate start to cause real wage growth to turn from sharply negative which has been all year to positive that could actually be a bit of a tailwind for consumers who yes are going to have to face The the lag defect of you know higher interest rates potentially less hiring going on less negotiation for nominal wage growth in their jobs But as long as real wages are coming up because inflation is moderating I think we should see the consumer carous forward at least into the second half of next year Which raises a question of whether we really can see the shallow recession now Yeah, that so many people are expecting this idea that we can get some sort of I don't want to say Goldilocks scenario But in a place where the fed can really cut rates do you feel like there is more resilience that we're seeing in the earnings of retailers and beyond from cuz uh  scenario, but in a place where the Fed can really cut rates, do you feel like there is more resilience that we're seeing in the earnings of retailers and beyond from consumers than to allow some of the lag effects to just take hold and inflation to really keep going up?%

So meanwhile, Brian, from your vantage point, do you see this as a possibly good thing or something that could be potentially problematic if China reopens a more and full based on the demand side for

buy shares are sharply higher up about 6.5\textbackslash{}\%.Lisa your right hedge funds have been strangely MIA from this recent rally we have data from Jake Morgan tracking long short funds and they've paired back bets in both books after pretty much being forced to cover their shorts in this latest bounce you're looking at a basket of the most shorted stocks versus the S\textbackslash{}\&P 500 as you can see it's pretty much the same chart almost there that's painful for some of these short sellers and that tepid risk appetite can also be seen in the options market let's look at open interest on both puts and calls it has been dropping over the past few weeks of course the trend is definitely higher versus this time last year but starting to have again just in the last month or so even with uncertainty building into year and at least we haven't even talked about crypto hedge funds could be looking at billions of dollars stuck at bankrupt exchange FTX we got a list of its 50 biggest creditors over the weekend more than three billion dollars owed that is just amazing now that list was redacted but we know there could be up to 150 crypto hedge funds with direct exposure Lisa and what the potential fall from that is the market and there is a lot of optimism now that the pace of rate increases is going to slow essential banks get a little bit more confident inflation is closer to a peak but that said you don't typically get markets reach your trough until interest rates actually start to come down we're still a long way away from that Limerick's Kayleigh lines is back with us Kayleigh 2022 has not been a pretty year for the equity market and it might not get prettier anytime soon granted it has gotten maybe less ugly over the last day month or so as inflation data has come and cooler than expected and we have seen somewhat of a rally the question is where do we go from here especially looking in to 2023 and still the S\textbackslash{}\&P 500 is down about 17\textbackslash{}\% year to date with of course losses far greater for tech stocks than Azdaq 100 is down more like 29\textbackslash{}\% and of course that is a result of higher borrowing costs the 10 year yield is about 230 basis points higher today than it was at the start of 2022 and that of course is due to higher fed rate expectations that terminal rate continually getting reprised upward as the year has gone on now up to about 5.2\textbackslash{}\% and we know that fed speakers like Jim Bullard  to higher fed rate expectations that terminal rate continually getting reprised upward as the year has gone on now up to about 5.2\textbackslash{}\%.They see a potential bottom in the first half and Marco Colonevic, what used to be the ultra bull over at JP Morgan says that and felt to tell the fed starts cutting rates assets will be range bound with a more pronounced downside risk.Joining us, Barry Bannister of Steffel, who has been arguing that the crisis in crypto is more contained, writing, quote, there is wealth destruction mainly the 20 to 30{-}something crowd who fell under the spell of decentralized finance and didn't understand the history of financial mania.Like even the Wall Street banks that have built out trading desks, specifically for crypto assets, that might not be a part of the decentralized finance kind of world, but something that is more of a speculative instrument.Thank you so much for that right now in markets more broadly you are seeing that lift Fade just a touch as people pass through Fed speak as companies buy back their own shares pick up Whatever technical reason you want you're seeing the S\textbackslash{}\&P now up about a third of a percent the Nasdaq down a little bit less He'll slightly lower their stability in yields

Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country.German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest.Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BVB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares.When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund footballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL.On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubing and it was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina God.The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system.A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data.One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids, which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into greater than four in time, they came quite close to Earth.The object and just nudge it out of the way, that's one possibility, and that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off its path a little bit with you know a massive object, a spacecraft one so it's kind of like bowling if you will, you know if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up.A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way.When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade.So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at its price and a ton of women just like attack that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, the this is what I was looking for.%

Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well{-}being and make very good decisions.As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the burbs.Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to layout fiber optic networks for Gigabit service.AT\textbackslash{}\&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable.The COVID{-}19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded \textbackslash{}\$43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone.Although outlawed seven decades ago caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities.The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world.That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system.It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex.And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads.And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start.It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID{-}19 companies weren't spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every one thousand views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views I made 30 cents but then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars and there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down why are they going to make content then instead you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher the second way that a YouTuber makes income is support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off Patreon was really the only option but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels so whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special icons next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and for me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t{-}shirts from last year right now you have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you you have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it you're not doing it for other people you're doing it for yourself if you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it huh so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about oh sweet I guess I can make the channel about that now how do I grow an audience how do I get popular it's all about diversification you have to have a massive Twitter following you have to have a massive Instagram following you have to have a massive YouTube following of course you have to be on twitch which is the key platform but basically anyway you can get in front of your audience you can engage with your audience and it is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms it's me and then playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them they're not just people who are good at games they're actually people who are good at online engagement online entertainment first and foremost you have the right to remain stylish anything you wear can and will be used to be seeing the quarter fashion the streamer is either very very talented at the game the best player in the game is generally going to draw crowd because people like watching people who are very good on the other hand they're either very very good or funny charismatic whatever it is on that side you know it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience there were those weird like Ronald McDonald like straight to VHS movies remember those I'm personable I'm chatty I would kind of you know when boring things were happening the game I would ramble on about you know movies I'd watched or books I'd read and you know or conversations I'd had  I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would

China actually has a very big e{-}commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers.And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in their sense of a music control especially during the pandemic.And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e{-}commerce.The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after Diver, Rano Koei{-}Vasari observed the strong back{-}and{-}forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea.Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt.But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind.In other words, Harinata had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Cohn.Beverly obtained her wealth from the shot and steam kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes.And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box.As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs, they're there right now.And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper, and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter.Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Abbey were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank.%

I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn.Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within.A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day.You know they're young lads hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent let's be clear but they're all part of this collective.And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of this was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money.So the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37, men if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of...  being month.So the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37, meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of ore they sold that month.The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively.In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop.A multi{-}regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers.Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track.Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make.%

Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand.Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners.The firm plans to allocate up to 10\textbackslash{}\% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina.At least the carbon is being done honestly, encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast, it's there, there's renewable power all over the world, we know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, 25\textbackslash{}\% of the original cost, we know how to do that now, we don't have an excuse to get into it.As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018, when he tasked the Snam scenarios team, with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050.In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment.Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix.But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, and as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap.The rapid collapse of Sam Bankman freed's crypto empire has sent a shock across the area industry that have been a poster child for market access.Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries on Nancy Lyons.So sorry to interrupt, but does that mean that they weren't directly connected to FTX, but a fall in digital asset prices has led them to have some sort of issue?%

And again, I'm not saying anybody, I mean, at least Barry Silver, we don't know anything that has gone wrong, but it's just interesting these singular individuals and how wide and vast the reach was in different verticals within the crypto world.Investors are recalibrating their expectations in response to federal officials, indicating they will continue to raise rates but are open to slowing their tempo.After earnings, analog devices up now by 4.9\textbackslash{}\% wait times for Apple's most expensive smartphones or rising to quarter or higher income to.Well, today's Bloomberg big take, it is about the housing markets around the globe that are wobbling under the weight of central bank rate hikes and how what happens in Canada, maybe a harbinger for the rest of the world.But on the sort of protecting that downside, setting a floor under prices, Canada, a nation of 34 million people is, you know, opened its doors to about 500,000 immigrants a year.a lot of the folks who come here most of them are typically you know well educated they're coming with some money they're coming to take uh... you know professional positions and this is really a sort of a core part of the Canadian economic strategy is to import uh... into poor people into the country uh... they you know they recognize that the population isn't going to uh... grow at the same rate here on its own so it's really a non{-}controversial left{-}right core plank of the Canadian economic philosophy here so that's uh... that's one factor that's uh... it's going to drive it um... i think that's uh... that's a kind of a thing to go right now in in terms of uh... what's causing that uh... that increase in demand alright we're leaving on that note he kevin uh... great story uh... the housing market so important to the global economy so fascinating uh... take kevin orland he's Canadian finance reporter blumberg news joining us via zoom from our toronto bureau check out the bloomberg big take uh... podcast at

thanks carol we do have some breaking news here we've just learned the supreme court has cleared the way for a house panel to receive former president trumps tax returns it ends a three year legal fight that the houseways and means committee had with trump the committee said it needs the returns to consider potential legislation on presidential compliance with tax roles while the white house

winter comes well we're hearing some of the harrowing stories from those who are in a colarado springs nightclub that was the scene of a mass shooting over the weekend military veteran rich fierreau helped disarm the gunman i just know i got into mode and i needed to save my family and that family was at that time everybody in that room witnesses say rich fierreau tackled the gunman and beat him with his own gun anderson aldrich lee is being held on charges of killing five and injuring nearly twenty others at the world cup saudi arabia stunned the soccer world today with a two to one went over argentina mexico and pollin played to a scoreless draw so did denmark and tenisa france the defending champ is ahead of australia right now two to one global news twenty four hours a day on air and on bloomberg quick take powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analyst and more than one hundred and twenty countries right now thank you so much nazi lions uh... with world and national news from our dc bureau so we're gonna talk a lot more about crypto and the fallout and what's going on uh... will do that a little bit around with capy woods in the meantime certainly this story has been uh... trending among the most red on the blueberg and i feel like whatever news organization it can have moved to the top in terms of what people are interested in this has to do with celebrity plugs within the crypto space the attempt to pay book in years quarterback tom Brady the golden state warrior stuff curry they're just among the celebrities that a texas regulator is investigating for potential securities law violations tied to their promotions of crypto exchange f t x okay here's the thing carol what do you think if you are tom Brady or stuff curry right before you get involved in pitching something you've got a team of lawyers that are coming through it to make sure you don't get stuck in a sticky situation right i don't say something that's right i would hope right i'm saying this with a question right right i would uh... yeah i mean the regulator is scrutinizing payments received by the celebrities to endorse f t x u s along with what disclosures were made and how accessible they were  Yeah, I mean the regulator is scrutinizing payments received by the celebrities to endorse FTX US along with what disclosures were made and how accessible they were to retail investors Joe Ratunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board telling Bloomberg news in an interview.The SEC has proposed new rules about disclosure and the antitrust regulators that suggest this department and the federal trade commission have both made some noise about how they have concerns here.The Justice Department opens a surprise probe a month or so ago into what are called interlocking director it's that's where a company or a person sits on the board of two competitors.And then the sort of center piece of our story was about this deal between Standard General, which is a hedge fund and a Tecna, which is the broadcast stations that were spun out of Gennat.Well, I mean, the Justice Department is continuing to investigate the interlocking directorates issue and also just whether having private equity owners is changing the incentives of some companies.Today, a big reason why analog devices, which is up 5\textbackslash{}\%, top of the Nasdaq 100, it's one of the largest makers of semis using industrial equipment and cars.I love they saying well if through 2024 so above 4\textbackslash{}\% and what that means is well high mortgage rates because the 10 years closely tied to 30 year mortgages are closely tied to the 10 year there's this there's this interesting stat carol the 10 year which is right about 3.76\textbackslash{}\% as you mentioned it's traded at 4\textbackslash{}\% are higher for 23 days so far in 2022 all of those have occurred since late September but before that the yield hadn't touched that level since early 2010 right so the think about rates and where they go longer term and where they stay and where they get sticky has risen right the expectations we're not talking shorter and we know the shorter and everybody expects it to be higher but that's important about where you think they will go and what the bets that are being made within the market 10 years out right so what does that do the housing market I don't know I mean it's definitely going to slow down but you know I was listening to Surreillance this morning and I can't remember there was Barry Redholtz or somebody else making the point millennials are buying homes like they're having kids they're friend of mine just bought a house yesterday so ultimately I said with these interest rates you need it to live you know what I mean and you're gonna make decisions based on what you need to live by so anyway got to kind of think about that a little bit let's get to world a national news Nancy Lions is in our 99 one studio hey Nance thanks Tim well after a three{-}year battle the House Ways and Means Committee will be receiving former president Trump's tax returns the Supreme Court cleared the way

rejected a deal that was brokered back in September even though other unions have signed on industry Groves urging Congress to step in policy analyst Isaac well Tonsky of the financial firm BTIG explained what it can do in a Bloomberg interview there's a law called the railway labor act and that let's Congress come in to either impose a resolution based on what the president's emergency board submitted this past summer or to check the can down the road to require operations for say three or six months well Tonsky said the Democratic lame duck Congress might choose to act rather than buck the issue to the next Republican House which might be less friendly to organized labor in Washington or champs and boomer gradia a spike in COVID{-}19 cases in China is raising concerns about the

You know, the whole world of the digital currency group and Barry Silver's company, I mean, the various connections that kind of go back to FTX.And yet retail investors do not have easy access through a liquid asset like an ETF, which, which honestly, I don't understand, given that they approved a Bitcoin futures fund.All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business week on radio TV, YouTube and on quick take right now We want to get a check on the market.Kathy Wood making news moments ago She spoke to us right here on Bloomberg Business week Kathy Wood of the arch{-}innovation fund says she is standing by Elon Musk and the changes he is making at Twitter if you look at the the daily average users I think the various metrics that you can count daily they have been going up dramatically.Chris what happened here because just a couple of months ago I believe it was the code conference in LA Bob Eiger was asked specifically Uh by Cara Swisher if he was going to come back as CEO and he pretty much He ruled it out.Trump's lawyers argued the panel lacked a legitimate legislative purpose and were seeking to make the documents public for political reasons.Dr. Anthony Fauci and what will likely be his final news conference before retiring next month says the new byvalent vaccine provides superior protection.At the World Cup, Saudi Arabia's surprise Argentine and one by a score of two to one, Mexico and Poland ended in a scoreless draw, so did Denmark and Tunisia, France defeated Australia 4{-}1.Yeah, the stock dropping after, but you know, spiking initially, Carol, and you know, we can't read too much into an immediate move at before a conference call comes out.Well, and I just want to say that some of the looks like the reaction in Nordstrom shares here in the aftermarket sinking in late trading after reporting a decrease in profitability in a mid{-}hired discounting.He said, quote, when customer demand decelerated in late June, we took action to align inventory and expenses with the changing trends, which has prepared us to navigate the current macroeconomic environment.This quarter, our teams continue to advance are closer to use strategy and supply chain capabilities as we focus on initiatives to drive profitable growth and achieve our long{-}term strategic and financial goals.%

Let's check in on these markets because actually we pushed higher now remember this is a holiday shortened week This means volumes are thin and they're down about 20\textbackslash{}\% from your average But the SB500 managed to climb back to the highest level since mid{-}September We thank in large part apple Microsoft some of your big tech heavyweights Which push these overall indexes high and Nasdaq at 1.4 so too is a Nasdaq 100 let's flip it gone though Because there was a little bit of optimism in the air when it comes to crypto too But actually is this more a story of dollar weakness than of course crypto strength over the last two trading days We know it's been under pressure, but look at this push higher a little bit one point trading up above \textbackslash{}\$16,000 when we're looking at Bitcoin Ed Yeah, some big news in the last hour car at HP ink will cut up to 6000 jobs over the next three years Representing a slow down in demand for personal computers that is its earnings disappoint The stock actually higher now in after hours It kind of been all over the place, but a big story will continue to monitor earnings continues to be a big story Right look at

salaries by 10 to 20 percent then Dispersing that money amongst the greater workforce kind of aligning itself with G's common prosperity Initiative really interesting story on the Bloomberg terminal and something's changing out there when it comes to China tech Yeah, really great global perspective Let's bring it back closer to home It's a global story of course because it hits across the world the FTX story and we emerged well from the first FTX bankruptcy Hearing on Tuesday and it included an attorney representing the firm saying a substantial amount of FTX's assets are well Missing let's break it all down in most Katie grife felt shock or we're almost becoming numb to it to certain degree Katie But what did you take away from the first hearing was a fiery first day?That's interesting when you try to map the contagion about what more shoes Are we waiting to drop we would like to know who's on that list, but it's going to remain under wraps for now Missing assets also a debate around the assets and who should be doing what about what talked us about what's happening in parallel in the Bahamas Katie well, that's the thing who actually what court has jurisdiction here is going to handle it That's been a sort of turf turf war that has erupted here We know that for now these doing liquidation proceedings in the Bahamas.And that was extremely powerful because the biggest learning out of the 2008 crisis and what eventually led to the vocal rule is, if market infrastructure companies start taking directional bets, the cascade amplification is going to be huge.So people have the opportunity to get online, sell things they're laying around their house and make a profit, potentially an extra couple of dollars in their pocket as we head into the holiday season.Not only does this item get a second life and not go to landfill, but you're also helping to avoid additional carbon emissions being put in the air, which is really critical when we're in a time of a climate crisis.Brian Armstrong, the CEO and Alicia, CFO have been leaning into what's going on right now and saying, OK, regulators, we need more clarity in order to protect investors.Plus, Rume Bozler learnt that the Binance CEO of course CZ met with Middle East investors to raise money for his crypto recovery fund he's been talking about.And of course, we reported yesterday, Genesis warning potential investors it may have to file for bankruptcy unless it can raise new money while acknowledging there's a \textbackslash{}\$2.8 billion in outstanding loans on its balance sheet including two related parties such as, well, it's a parent company, DCG.For more on the state of the industry, the person who's behind a lot of this breaking news is Shanali Basakshis with us and Avala perhaps, President John Woo, please to say is with us as well.And then you'll have perhaps banks come in to pick up the pieces and buy parts of the market structure because they'll be more comfortable and they'll inject a lot of liquidity.I don't know, let's not forget it was just last week that the New York Fed was talking about digital dollar and pilots there So there's still innovation to be had and AvAlarbs President John Muir we thank him for coming on and just talking about the space and we get some sleep Bloomberg shanali bass like as well all over the story we thank him he won't coming up a surprise
