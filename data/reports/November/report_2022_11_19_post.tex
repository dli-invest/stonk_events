But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense.And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL.Back then, you know, 2016, they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian.I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink.Take it home and open the box and show it on the camera.By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand.And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over \textbackslash{}\$10 billion in retail sales worldwide.The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Gligar here.And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals.And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos.For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity.In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay \textbackslash{}\$3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls.%

When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away.I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another.Keep your rent and... With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars.If you've seen sci{-}fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you and never be able to build in the first place.The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer, made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth.Using the unique properties of microgravity they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs.A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend and hope that the right buyer walks through that door.We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City Instagram accounts like circus houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life Often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities by the end of 2020 New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of \textbackslash{}\$2,700 a month for an apartment even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them They grew up online.We became really interested in one YouTube video 20 Z{-}LO photos that is it The red{-}hot housing market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic getting eyeballs strictly through social media People are not looking in the the back section of the times anymore for for real estate listings our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media And they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms This is Joshua Gelb and Pepe hamburger During the pandemic the two New York City{-}based developers started Neville House a new construction project two hours north of the city I'm like most traditional real estate listings the pair bypass the use of a broker and advertise their homes directly on Instagram No fees no commissions You used to have to hire a broker work with them.So like all birds with shoes Casper with mattresses or warby Parker with glasses all of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items Ten years ago the broker would drive the search now I think that my clients text me listings.Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent.When I was 24 years old I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill and then at the end of the fight the combatants hugged they shook hands and I just fell in love with it.%

On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US Dispray Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Quarry, and John Fitch attached to the suit.A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well.And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50\textbackslash{}\% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing.The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure.A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones.It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade.Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor.On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.With more than 90\textbackslash{}\% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer.We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soine corn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in.When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families and from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing to have dinner that tastes good?Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed.%

CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship.The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer CD Projekt Red.The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development.There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end.Other open world games felt empty and forced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water.And then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman And there was also two cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff, but It wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 the cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show and they showed off a It was like a two{-}minute trailer of cyberpunk look pretty rad And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score an appointment in there They showed this 45{-}minute demo and it blew people away Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title cyberpunk 2077 The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game everything you see is potentially subject to tune Holy This if they can live up to what they showed me It's game over It all looked incredibly impressive They had enough action enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension They touted how each of these NPCs there are thousands of them each one with their own daily routines and everything We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game So yeah, so People were certainly blown away by this demo at 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake Fake demos are common at E3 studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long It kind of plays into this idea that CD projects is very much a marketing driven company and so demos were really really important to them So it was really important that they make the demo blow people away, which it did But that might have come at the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game a year later at E3 2019 Fans would get another big surprise of being there of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking You're a breathtaking The cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities beautiful lighting Really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous cyberpunk world They saw over 8 million pre{-}orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell let alone pre{-}sell And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right You know pretty pretty much in a straight line if you just look at like the Polish stock market like the wig index when CD project stock was at a tie it was the largest stock in the in the in the index and that was around the time That they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020 behind the Seaheens people were pretty shocked that they were saying April I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020 So in April of 2019 I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem Which is a game from Bywa that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was And afterwards they started hearing from other developers who had Stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem the deadline is unrealistic The direction keeps changing things are floundering we're going through a lot of problems This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem around that same time Perhaps go incidentally  Changing things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems.So, Marchinevinsky, who's a co{-}founder and co{-}CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project.The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies.North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding, it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home.Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism.A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American Dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great Nasee's and they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them.That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much and by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff.%

President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state.When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people.In 1968, Avantio{-}Ramada and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina.It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion.During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism.It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable, and that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market.As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017.So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate, you're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington DC.So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office.As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self{-}driving cars, why can't you fix this now?So to me, a really natural part, you know, kind of a sister organization to investing for long{-}term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top.Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete.%

You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust.The Facebook follow out, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health.You may go to a doctor's office, and go through a scan, and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion.The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology and when I look at last week us launching a affordable smartphone in India the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online.Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau.And next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers.But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant.And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously, but it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there back internally to how can we build those things.Well he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe so he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be but that being said obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly be it in person or via email just on the most important things going on in the business.Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias.So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS.I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users.%

First of all, I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice.Brent crude dips below \textbackslash{}\$90 a barrel for the first time since October on global demand concerns and that's despite Saudi Arabia cutting oil exports shortly this month.Sources tell Bloomberg that Elon Musk's hard{-}core ultimatum to staff has prompted more of an employee ex{-}illustin he expected, potentially putting the company's operations at risk.At the same time, US 10 year yields range bound at \textbackslash{}\$376.20 overnight though there was a lashing for treasuries by the hawkish talk with the Fed peaks seen above 5\textbackslash{}\% especially on the short end of the curve.It's been a volatile couple of hours but the key point here is that we're seeing weakness in crude broadly for the week despite Saudi Arabia cutting exports \textbackslash{}\$430,000 a day by mid{-}November.And as you mentioned as well, Neil Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, all throughout saying look, he needs to be very sure that inflation has stopped accelerating before there's any kind of a conversation about pausing on the whole rate hike and cycle.Now, earlier this week, Elon Musk issued an ultimatum to Twitter employees, either committed to the company's new hardcore work environment or leave.And some employees who were leaving speculated that so many are now departing along with their knowledge of how the product works, that the social media network may have trouble fixing or updating systems during its normal operations.North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile after warning the U.S. of fierce moves if it continues conducting joint military drills with allies in the region.The 82{-}year{-}olds announcement concludes her history making tenure as the first woman to serve a speaker and opens the way for a generational change in the party's congressional leadership.There is still a coordinated commitment amongst committee members to push on the hawkish button, but that doesn't mean that the destination is necessarily a higher rate than where markets thought a week or two ago, or where was hinted by Jerome Powell following the last Fed meeting.We also had some comments out from Howard Marx from Oak Tree, who has a track record of injecting attention{-}grabbing headlines to the global market narrative every three to four months.%

The most important factor is growth and yesterday we had austerity the UK is already heading towards recession so I think it's going to underperform peers because a lot of other European countries have done the opposite Germany's done a big spending package.The UK is now tightening its fiscal belt so I think the likes of sterling Swiss shorts are nice risk off hedge and also an underperformance in Europe story works against the sort of long euro dollar position we have.Morning Anna, North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile a day after warning the US over continued military drills with allies in the region.Twitter has closed its offices until Monday after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave.Raising the stakes, Wall Street closes in the red as James Bullard ups the ante on his view of Fed Hikes, but Asia stocks and European futures push a little higher.Fleet Reality UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt lays out a harsh economic future of weak growth and rising taxes as Britain's face a record drop in living standards.But we've had things like China COVID cases rise higher than expected, leading many to think that the reopening story isn't going to happen anytime soon, meaning oil demand is lower.Remember, when this was announced, they said that they did not agree with the decision, the fact that the richer actively changed some of the terms was not good form from the ECB, so I guess it'll be interested to see one of the two collide and whether or not some of the tensions perhaps have cooled now.It screens about 60 basis points cheap to US credit, because obviously our market has been more impacted by the Ukraine situation, and we're going to have a more energy crisis, so our spreads have been a little bit more beaten up here in Europe.But now we hear the sort of hawkish drum being hit once again by the likes of James Bullard, talking about terminal rates getting to the low fives, and even this idea that, you know, well, maybe there's a reason to take them up as far as seven.But, you know, what I've done for my reporting is learned that there is an internal presentation going around suggesting security forces aren't going to heavily police some social codes, including public drunkenness protests, which, you know, are not particularly legal here.Twitter has closed its offices until Monday, after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave.%

UK Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt lays out 55 billion pounds of tax hikes and spending cuts as Britain's face a record drop in living standards.This sentiment ebbs Asia stocks trim gains as US futures turn lower after James Bullard raises his view on how high the Fed needs to hike rates.So raising his view on where the terminal rate will end up, as Francine was saying, building on the core center of those fidd officials pushing back on any idea that you're going to get a pivot or need a pause from the Federal Reserve.And I guess there's a bit of a disconnect, which we'll get to Ben Gutridge about the fact that the market is expecting inflation to come down, but at the same time, they believe that we could be talking about cuts at the moment, which is not what the Fed officials are saying at all.And look, the labour market may be issuing some signs of weakness in terms of sort of job openings, but really, I think businesses are reluctant to lay off staff, because it's so difficult to find them.What's the value proposition for FTSE 250 company that actually has, you know, very little outward selling points and is dealing with all of the challenges, including high cost of living, mortgages going up, but also not finding the right staff?In an effort to break deadlocked climate talks in Egypt, the European Union has proposed a loss and damage finance facility for the most vulnerable countries.So we would make that system fairer to bring in more money to help people with their bills over the next few months and potentially years, but just on the energy issue, you know, the short{-}term sticking plaster approach of this government, it just isn't good enough.I think the Resolution and Foundation have said that the permanent damage done by that has left a 30 billion black hole in the government finances, and mortgage rates are still not back to where they were before that mini budget.So we would look to get the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, UK participation in the horizon scheme, reducing the bureaucracy for our fantastic creative industries at the moment find it difficult to tour across Europe.Okay Rachel Reeves we appreciate your time thank you very much indeed UK shadow chancellor of the exchequer with that response to the autumn statement let's check in on these markets then I'll start with a FTSE 100 given that conversation you can't be seeing very modest gains of two tenths of a percent again within the energy space you've seen a bit of relief on the assessment around that 45\textbackslash{}\% windfall tax from the chancellor so that's a 3 tenths of a percent gain across the FTSE 100 more broadly across the European stocks benchmark you've seen gains of five tenths of a percent stateside though S\textbackslash{}\&P Eamonies counting down a tenth of a percent and as that futures in similar territory are francing we've been discussing this of course the conversation at least the pushback from Fed officials James Bullard suggesting that you have to get to at least five to five and a quarter percent in terms of the terminal rate that pushback from a Fed officials around some of the sentiment within these markets that maybe you're close to a pause or a pivot yeah and we've seen this actually over the last 12 months right the fact that the markets believe that when you reach peak inflation then interest rate hikes will ease off and then you hear from officials and frankly also former governors of you know maybe the bank of England or even former ECBs and saying even if you want to reach your target it still means aggressive cuts and this is why you have this economy between what you know the speeches and the Fed officials are saying what the markets are seeing indeed and when it comes to the ECB there is an expectation our own reporting that you're going to get 50 basis points are a step down from 75 basis points to 50 basis points later this month we are waiting for Madame Lagarde of course of the ECB who's going to be giving a speech any moment now check on the euro briefly because the single currency is currently down a tenth of a percent currently trading at 1.03 the pound by the way gaining 3.10\textbackslash{}\% at 1.18 will keep across some of the other asset classes as well in terms of your treasuries and the yield curve after the run up of yields yesterday again tying into that commentary from Fed officials you're seeing yields up just around two basis points at the front end 4.47 on your US two year the 10 year 378 that's a move high by two basis points briefly looking at guilt as well yields up five basis points at the front end 3.16 again investors still digesting the fallout of the autumn statement from the chance let the 10 year guilt 3.23 that's a move higher by three basis points friends now some of the other things we're watching yesterday in the US we had some fresh data showing weekly jobless claims for example came below the forecast further underscoring the strength of the labor market so I think if you look at country by country is certainly region by region it's very different if you're sitting in the US I'm looking at US mortgage rates and they were posting their biggest weekly decline since 1981 and that briefly improved sentiment but when you look at where we are you just need to think about a affordability and we're just having a great conversation there with the shadow chance of the extracurricular reefs about what you'd be doing with mortgage rates and also it was interesting to to hear or you know say about Brexit I'm saying well look we can't reverse this because I want to be chance of the fact that it often feels like you know Brexit is a bad word that can't be uttered if you want to be elected the conspiracy of silence as I think the financial times put it but it was really fascinating response and it points to that determination of course to get into power but the risks around as they say within the Labour Party of addressing that issue even as the polls suggest that people are increasingly distant chanted with the fallout of of Brexit now we are getting some lines from Madame regard of the ECB saying that the risk of recession has increased for Anne C recession unlikely to quell inflation significantly so we'll hear from them in a gal that very shortly but first let's get

So in this setting, displaying commitment to our mandate is vital to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored, and that second round effects do not take hold.But in the current environment and acknowledging that interest rates remain the most effective tool for shaping our policy stance, it is appropriate that the balance sheets of the central bank is normalized in a measured and predictable way.So let's not forget this was a few months ago, but it is still there and being used and drawn upon the 750 billion euro's next generation EU fund with its focus on green and digital spending is a good tool for ensuring that investment flows where it is needed over the next few years.These currencies could give banks a tool to offer improved products and services, built on the stable foundations of digital public money.So I think that they basically gave themselves a rather confusing instruction in December of last year, which essentially mixed a time{-}bound pace of hiking with data dependency.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, to lay bare a bleak new reality for the country's economy and his autumn statement, one plagued by weak growth and rising taxes for years to come.Well, to talk about the UK, we're joined by Guillermo Filices, global investments for NHSEP, PGM, Fixed Income, and Bloomberg's John Stepig.Bleak Outlook, the UK Chancellor, Jeremy Hunter lays out 55 billion pounds of tax hikes and spending cuts as Britain's face a record drop in the big standards.Rick's sentiment ebbs, Asia stocks, trim gains as U.S. futures turn lower after James Bullard raises his view on how high the Fed needs to high{-}grates.Plus the ultimate and backfires Elon Musk's demand for hardcore loyalty prompts an exodus head Twitter and is said to put day{-}to{-}day operations at risk.The risks that poses is not necessarily they don't have the head count because you know there are lots of people floating around Silicon Valley right now who have lost their jobs and maybe you can review some of those.Now joining us now is Danny Rumor, he is partner index ventures of tech focus VC firm behind Dropbox, Robin Hood, Etsy Deliveroo, but also Glossier.%

And I think this is sort of the difference because you also have a lot of automatic stabilizers, you know, cumulative exact savings of close to \textbackslash{}\$2.5 trillion, corporate balance sheets being a fairly resilient compared to where they were in 2008 for example.And then over the weekend the 2022 World Cup kicks off on Sunday bringing billions of viewers and millions of fans to the tiny Gulf state of Qatar.But as the matches approach, environmentalists are claiming that Qatar has greenwash the world cup and that the event will put millions of megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.However, organizers argue that this World Cup will be more energy efficient than others since fans won't have to fly to different venues and can instead just take public transit.In addition to the development goals that were part of hosting the event here, note that just five years ago, Qataris neighbors, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, as well as Egypt cut off abruptly, trade, diplomatic and travel ties leaving Qatar essentially out on its own.And how much is this really this question mark around social media platforms right now because there was a story in the Wall Street Journal also this morning that met a laid off a number of staff were taking bribes to overcome to interfere with certain accounts.Now it's going to be interesting to see and we're going to be of course covering this through the day Katie Greiffelt I've really scheduled on the crypto uproar somewhere through the morning as well and we're thrilled I hope to bring you Mendy Pseung of Bloomberg Intelligence who's in cyclopedic on what goes on behind the walls of the Silicon Valley companies.Metas fired or disciplined more than two dozen employees and contractors in the past year for improperly taking over user accounts sometimes allegedly for bribes.That's according to the Wall Street Journal and that report says some workers are accused of accepting thousands of dollars in return for giving hackers access to user accounts.A metas spokesman told the journal that the company will continue taking appropriate action against people that sell fraudulent services and target its platforms.I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know, some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum.Yes and look this is this is a good conference because you have the the central bankers but also the bankers here the Deutsche Bank CEO is right there and I believe in fact he was a China with the Christian Lagarde at the the break but she did talk about this she talked about the energy factors she talked about how the bills of course play into inflation that's why we continue to see inflation go up everyone in Europe that I know including myself by the way I've seen my bills go up pretty much every month now for three months and of course that plays into their mandates she repeated she insisted we have to get to a 2\textbackslash{}\% target we are going to continue to hike there is potentially a recession that will manifest but nonetheless we need to hit our mandate that is 2\textbackslash{}\% so the message for me today in this conference is that even in a recession the European Central Bank come December will hike again they will hike into recession the question is 50 basis points 75 basis points but the direction of travel is very clear she laid it out today very clearly we have to hike even though we're potentially going to be in a recession and Henry Hurdern we've been talking about the collision course that we've been seeing so far from the monetary policy and the fiscal policy makers the congress members in the US politicians around the world who do not want to see people lose their jobs it is bad for them who don't want to see the economic pain but right now it's okay because the pain hasn't gotten that deep how much has that pushback really spread beyond just a small cadre of of people in congress right now well it hasn't ready spread within the democratic party right this was the voices of say you had independent from Vermont Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren really starting that but then also as a October before the last fedeism you had top democrat Sheridan Brown writing this letter to chair Powell saying do not forget about the unemployment market we don't want to see the risks of jobs as you go on this aggressive campaign to fight inflation basically make sure the medicine is not worse in terms of the current  Upps, as you go on this aggressive campaign to fight inflation, basically make sure the medicine is not worse in terms of the cure.%

they're preparing for some real shift in policy on a number of different fronts that could question some of the other domestic issues like for example commodities.Good morning everyone, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom Keane on radio on television, Bloomberg surveillance, forget about sliding into the weekend and extraordinary news.We saw home builder sentiment fall off a cliff to levels that we haven't seen going back more than a decade if you strip out the pandemic ramifications, a fast moving story.Well you see no if you actually take a look at recessions historically you know they they could see markets down you know easily between 30 and 40\textbackslash{}\% but this is the most important single line that you know I think people are missing markets have never bottomed before a recession has begun look back at the historical data and that's why you know you see these bear market rallies you see short covering you see the fact that we're in the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter is always a good quarter you know all those things are true too but what we have to do is actually price in what is going what is going to happen in the future and when you said earlier you know let's take a look at housing as a leading indicator right right now you know housing houses the houses that were started a year ago when interest rates was 3\textbackslash{}\% need to be completed so the amount of housing unemployment that's taking place is virtually zero we think that there'll be 400,000 people unemployed in housing next year and about 2 million people who will be unemployed across the economy which is not especially deep recession but it's certainly not positive employment growth as we've seen almost all year long David what does this mean in terms of what you're recommending to share clients I mean if they're talking about a long and deep recession is it's hideout and tenure treasuries is this hiding out in T{-}bills until we have a better sense of what's going to happen yeah we are deeply wavly so over we are deeply overweight bonds at the moment you know we think that bonds are going to be a terrific investment by the way because you know if you buy a 10{-}year bond today let's say 380 right and it happens to go to you know 3\textbackslash{}\% and you hold it for a year and change you know that total return on that bond could be 10\textbackslash{}\% because we think interest rates are going to be down a year to a year and a half from now you know we think the long term rate on the 10{-}year community between 250 and 3 and that's because once a recession begins rates will of course you know come down and once we have unemployment prints for a couple of months yeah I will finally realize there's vocal did they have to do something about it well your economics team and good morning Andrew Hollinor's has been way out front on the slowdown that called David Bale and we've got a stagger to December 2nd and all of a sudden the jobs report which is of interest are we going to see the unemployment rate move in December yet or does that await till the first week of January well it certainly could you know Tom the the rate has come down relatively little so far you know but what we're seeing are you know the postings come down we're seeing a lot of pre{-}announcements of layoffs all across the tech industry some of the names you were talking about you know are are planning you know 10 and 15 thousand you know layoffs index you know next year but those haven't happened yet and of course we haven't seen this sort of industrial companies right off anybody because of the hoarding of labor David thank you for the brief David Bale and city group global wealth just thrilled to have them on today right now

And on some end, we get reports like my own just a few weeks ago, where I saw an internization talking about how security forces wouldn't even approach people who were giving public displays of affection, even protesting for gay rights.But Jane, how do you factor in the fact that Europe has essentially escaped the worst case scenario of an energy crisis heading into a cold winter when it's actually warmer than expected, and it seems like they've stockpiled enough natural gas?Meanwhile Pope Francis said in an interview the Vatican is available to do quote everything possible to mediate president Flo Demir Zalensky maintains that only the return of territory taken by Russia will allow and to the war.North Korea has fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile a day after warning the U.S. over continued military drills with allies in the region.And JP Morgan Chase made sweeping improvements to its employee benefits including getting 16 weeks of leave for the birth adoption of a child.Under a new policy, employees will also be eligible for up to four weeks paid time off to care for a seriously ill spouse domestic partner child or parent.I'm a little more skeptical about that China and the US both do not want to see nuclear force in the European continent The regulators here in the Bah'u is our ongoing with their investigation into FTX With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries the moment news breaks 24 hours a day Bloomberg your global business authority We're in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution It's a couple with the speed of the digital revolution nobody covers climate change like Bloomberg your global business authority We will never break we will never break build on a foundation strong enough to stay we will never break I will write a roses and the mountains shake all over we'll remain we will never know we will never know So reality is inflation both here and globally is a problem and central banks have created or at least made the problem worse by staying too easy For too long after the pandemic and that liquidity and and that does that stimulus has to be so We're going to see in 2020 and particularly is true skill and experience with a bank of England wonderful to speak to Mr.But clearly the user experience comes from the fact that you know, you have to constantly improve features and make it easy for people to engage with the platform.Especially if you're right, Tom, if they lose people on the infrastructure side in terms of who is really provisioning the app and making sure, you know, it can't handle these many users.I also think that heading into year end, and this is the reason why there's this real tension, I was looking last night at 4.30 p.m. Eastern at the Fed balance sheet, because that's what I do on Thursdays.When you look beyond that though to the people who don't necessarily see gloom there are a few of them including Torsten Slock over at Apollo saying the soft landing idea could be coming back to the floor because inflation is rolling over right.Because that is on this Friday with the other, the inversion when Jim Bianco talked about the distinctive thing to me of worry of slowdown is Brent crude 97 to 88 in 12 cups of coffee.%

We've seen similar bipartisan support on issues like Ukraine, but certainly, there are really big questions right now on what's going to happen next year when the debt ceiling needs to be raised and Congress needs to have that debate.I mean, how has the fallout been from the prospect of some fiscal austerity that we heard yesterday paired with the inflationary outlook and discussion from Katharman at the Bank of England today over at that European Confab?Guy Johnson, putting it really well there, talking about how we haven't seen it play out, the interplay of fiscal monetary policy, Sabajra Joppa, Jim Karen, both back with us.Subatara Japa, Jim Karen, have a wonderful weekend coming up the morning calls and later cross marks Bob Dole looking for a pause in higher yields to offer some relief.So Bob, very much echoing some of what you were saying, looking for that stability in the bond market in the meantime though, are there pockets of equities that you see attractive, particularly as some of these left for dead names, perhaps before a slight bit better than expected?The gain sticking from the pre market to now lease that of course is the meme stocks AMC of 4\textbackslash{}\% and apparently Disney's black Panther is expected to do very well at the box office again this weekend after speaking with Bob doll.And lawmakers are basically pushing to give the FTC some teeth in policing Twitter, which already has a 2011 agreement with the agency to have minimum standards when it comes to the data protection of its users.We are concerned about future earnings growth, giving cost pressures, high margins, strong dollar in demand destruction from higher rates.But before we get into some of the public ones that I know that you focus on very much, how do you really view the story of a company that was just the subject of a \textbackslash{}\$44 billion leverage to buy out with a lot of investors behind that now suddenly with question marks existential about its existence?Sarah, I would do wonder, though, if there's a bigger concern around social media companies in general, Metta's another one Facebook, Wall Street Journal reporting that Congress is looking into after they actually reported that they find and fired certain employees for accepting bribes to potentially interfere with certain accounts, how much is there going to be such increased scrutiny that it's hard to really put any money behind a social media company right now?Given the sort of idiosyncratic nature of specific tech names, how much have you moved away from indexes and really toward a very different type of bucketed investing strategy than you've had over the past 10 years?As a growth investor for the past 10 years, you actually had to have, they tended to have lower active share because you had to own those top index names at an overweight in order to beat the benchmark.%

She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a monitor of cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest.Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country.German investigators say the explosive devices, used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus, contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest.Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares.When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL.Ultimately, Vayner Gold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany.The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system.A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data.One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the gradient of them forward in time, they came quite close to Earth.NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forward in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth.We have lots of options if you can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way, that's one possibility, and that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about, just nudge it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft, so it's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up.A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way.%

Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4{-}chain{-}like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4{-}chain, Founda Bloomberg Terminal.And you would look at Wall Street Bets, and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock, and it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense.Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial wellbeing and make very good decisions.As a result, rural areas have exploded, and they're poised to experience a resurgence, as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms.Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber{-}aptic networks for Gigabit service.AT\textbackslash{}\&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable.The COVID{-}19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded \textbackslash{}\$43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone.Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities.Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers and then this girl used to sell vegetables but thanks to the residential education institutions she came to the Gowlido de campus and then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems and today I am so happy to share with you that you know she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usman in medical college and then in future she hopes to be a gynecologist so this is the journey our children are hoping for similarly the Mount Everest expansion.That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system.It uses a large central plant for cool water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex.And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads.%

How about one of China's biggest e{-}commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016.During eastern qi hip to coin does a huge amount of prices, with a chiffon on the couch and the shelf, can it actually have a greatadi joint, which is this nearby spoon.And then the live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in a sense of like losing control especially during the pandemic.And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function, adding interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e{-}commerce.In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country.In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation.The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koei{-}Vasari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea.Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt.But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind.In other words, Harinada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gones.Beverly obtained her wealth from the Shottenstein kind of retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American eagle outfitters, DSW shoes.As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now.%

A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some part to play and what happened.So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8, potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month.In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about.And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, that should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream.So, carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions.The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost effectively.In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop.But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment, to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track.And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing.A multi{-}regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers.Recently, the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a six{-}mile{-}long test track.Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make.%

Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners.Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference and he policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now okay, big business is transacting with Greenhutton in multi{-}billion dollar agreements, we now know it's here at the state that's spread everywhere.As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Sam Sinerius team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050.Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Sam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power.We have businesses in China and in India and I see a lot of hydrogen development a lot of renewable development in both countries The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030 some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30 he announced a big big commitment to get the 50\textbackslash{}\% renewables I was surprised that they would make it so explicit and even the net zero is a big thing for them And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and Hydrogen India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil diesel to keep the lights on so there's an immediate opportunity there And we're very interested in working that country and with regards to China perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership It's gonna be technology.I think China has committed to a net zero Which is very important at the G20 China was clearly behind the one and a half Degrees so I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and and cop and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years How quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15 20 years It's about building the project the capital is there We we we saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in Marco Alvera CEO of Snam there speaking with our Maria today Let's turn out to the aviation industry It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that in October the International Air Transport Association a trade body representing airlines A proof to target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 to achieve that many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy Sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for Travel without hurting the environment.Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix.Twitter owner Elon Musk has sent out an email to all of the social media platforms, software engineers, requesting that they report to the company San Francisco headquarters for a meeting at 2 p.m. local time today, urging employees to fly to the Bay Area to be present in person, only those who cannot physically get to San Francisco or who have family emergencies are excused, this according to Musk in the email, which was viewed by Bloomberg.So if there are some sort of a collapse in commodities, which certainly hasn't happened, there's been a very orderly sell off this year, then I would think that that would be another shot across the bow that you're going to have some difficult trading ahead for stocks.New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries will his officially seeking to replace house speaker Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader as she steps down.Because going back to what Tim says, and we've been talking about this all week, that venture capitalists tend to love these crazy people that often look a little bit offbeat and are seen as geniuses and brilliant, right?As described in court filings in the District of Columbia, is the investigation into into whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021.%

The Department of Justice has long recognized that in certain extraordinary cases it is in the public interest to appoint a special prosecutor to independently manage an investigation and prosecution.The investigation into whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or with the certification of electoral college vote held on or about January 6.In 1999 he became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York where over the course of nine years he prosecuted matters ranging from gang murders of police officers to civil rights violations.Most recently Mr. Smith served as a chief prosecutor for the special court in the Hague charge with investigating and adjudicating war crimes in Kosovo.And every time...  because you know trump supporters would say for the last six years democrats have thrown everything they can at donald trump and every time even though he's been impeached twice he's walked away on skate that's right and especially hard to answer that question because yes this has been you know he's teflon uh... but january six really changed the picture i think in the document investigation at marilago change the picture they know they have goods has been suggested that they believe they have enough to indict now but when you add the investigation in the mob at the capital and you know that they're trying to delineate between some of these cases get some of them uh... sort of shielded from the rest of of d o j that's the point is the special council to take this out of the attorney general's hands and and and have some some what of a and an outsider or an objective observer if you will making judgments here and can continue in this investigation but they have an enormous amount of evidence to pour through the question is when we actually get to see it alright really appreciate you weighing in on this the host of bloomberg sound on joe math you can find him

commit to the companies new hard core work environment or get it out and also and also most recently he's saying that all of the social media platform software engineers must come to its headquarters for a meeting this afternoon even urging employees to fly to san francisco to be there in person does everyone have a private jet that i don't think the question car Wagner wrote that piece along with maxwell adler car Wagner re{-}joins this now he is in from san francisco he's technology porter for bloomburn is he has been all over this story could go to have you back with us i want to start with the fact that i can still use twitter right now and last night before i went to bed it was like twitter was on death row awaiting to be executed and i wake up this morning and there it is it still works what's going on yeah i mean it's the last night twitter was like a very sad place uh... if you if you like the product and use it because you're right it felt like everyone was just you know the night before the world ending or something like that twitter is working you know everything we are hearing and and and and  the night before the world ending or something like that.And Garland

brand's marketing plans at the last minute.The move also highlighting misunderstandings among the world's largest brewer, the conservative Muslim country and FIFA, the international governing body of football over a partnership global data said was worth 72 million dollars and to be fairs are reporting rights and points out it also paints a be in in Bev into a corner since the brewer is unlikely to want to start a big public spat with the secretive football body and the host nation just as this tournament gets underway.Okay, a be in Bev may lose out on potential business and stadiums such sales are not the main goal of these kinds of deals in the run up to the World Cup Budweiser launch to marketing campaign based on its sponsorship.So, want to help me out here because in your report, and you say that Guyonet's leaders have promised to create a different kind of petrostat, an environmentally sustainable one that uses oil revenue to build a more durable infrastructure powered by renewable energy.I'm just trying to say that here we are coming off of it's still earnings that drives stock movements here as we try to make sense of what the Fed's going to do ultimately we can't really figure out the big macro story.But on November 16th, the European Union at Board of Appeals overruled that decision, according to our news, meaning he now has the ability to seek intellectual

Bottom line here, equities, little change, oil futures dropping below \textbackslash{}\$80 a barrel, a day after fed policy makers re{-}emphasize that interest rates still need to head higher to battle inflation.You know we really don't they use the word expeditiously a lot during this attorney general Merrick Garland had a meeting earlier issued a statement and they said that this is not going to slow down the investigation.I mean I've spoken with some former federal prosecutor types who said that appointing a special counsel will definitely slow things down just because you have to get all these investigators up to speed higher staff get an office for this independent role.So I mean these are legitimate criminal investigations that need to be resolved and now that he's announced he's running for office this appointment of a special counsel is supposed to give.Some of the people that I've spoken with in terms of timing, they've said that they would really have to make a decision on charging by spring because how else would you have a whole criminal trial potentially having before an election, before the primaries?And Biden commenting fresh from his trip to the G20 summit in Asia next week or hearing mean time the G7 will be setting a price cap on Russian oil that's courting twos.Commenting fresh from his trip to the G20 summit in Asia next week, we're hearing meantime the G7 will be setting a price cap on Russian oil, that's according to sources to Bloomberg.West Texas, NVIDIA crew down 1.7 percent a day after Federal Reserve Puddle Seemakers re{-}emphasize that interest rates still need to head higher to battle inflation.US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry is isolating after testing positive for COVID{-}19, complicating efforts to reach a new international agreement in Sean L. Shake Egypt.But if you look at just sort of on a quarter to date basis, just taking a slightly higher level view, clearly, we've seen the dollar finally depreciate, about 7 percent from the peak from late September.And so maybe the Fed does move the aggregate demand curve to such a degree after, let's say, hitting that 5\textbackslash{}\% terminal rate that we start to see the economic deceleration that they anticipated.Good way to say it, and a lot of kind of movement all around the place, as we move to that repositioning, if you will, even on in today's trade, we just talk with Aaron Kenan over at Clear Harbor Asset Management.%

There's a tentative labor agreement in place for railroad workers, but if the union votes know could be some drama this weekend, Congress might have to step in more from Bloomberg Xamie Morris.I can't answer that question for you, but I can tell you if you look at the longer term chart, what you can see is it's back to levels that it was pre pandemic.That shift has been a substantial drag on Carvana's business and his word wall street analyst with Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas saying recently that this stock could be worth as little as a dollar.Carvana though this month cited the weakening used car market and the broader economy when it's quarterly earnings, missed analyst estimates.The company though, the latest in the series of firms across industries to trim its ranks as conditions deteriorate, FedEx said earlier this week it's going to furlough some workers.ations........................................................  sent you to date but more than about thirty percent since november nine that's when the company reported earnings after the close so let's get into it david joining us via zoom from torrents california david nice to have you here how are you i'm very good hi carol well tell us a little bit about the environment because it you know depending on where you are in kind of the auto world you might have a good story you might have a bad story so what's your story we have a very good story i'll tell you uh... you know we've been around for twenty five years and we just announced our eleventh consecutive order of double digit year{-}over{-}year growth uh... we just reported a hundred sixty four million dollars of sales are he'd be dies up a hundred seventy four percent so as a company we're doing great what's the environment look like because it is tough for some companies right now to navigate what's going on when it comes to supply chains when it comes to use car prices coming down david what are you seeing listen i'm seeing the environment changing around me every day you guys see it you are the consumer is getting pinched right at the gas pump at the grocery store with interest rates so you know it's an opportunity for companies like us to double down on efficiencies and double down on continuous improvement and figuring out a way how to pass on savings to the customers and give them a reason to shop with us well so when you are doubling down and thinking about where to conserve or not uh... we talked about carvana planning to lay off about eight percent of its staff that was the headline that we had uh... today are you guys bracing um... david in your story for a slow down are you bracing for a recession and might layoffs be a part of that you know i i think the environment is definitely changing and it's a good time to double down on you know free cash flow staying that free positive unit economics and really really go back to the fundamentals of serving the customer needs so for us it's been a laser focus on number one customer experience and number two being fiscally conservative so we've always been very fiscally conservative especially over the last three years you know we have a more free cash flow positive or virtually debt free as we get into twenty twenty three which might be a recession uh... it's an opportunity to really double down on that all right so but as you double down as you said i mean customers come first you need people to make sure customers come first but if you are feeling the pressure i mean are all bets often meaning that if you need to cut costs and if that means workers that could happen yeah i i don't think we're in that position i think we've been in a good spot for the last three years we've been very disciplined about you know increasing headcounts uh... so right now we're in a good position and we also have a ton of opportunities operationally to find efficiencies not only on the marketing side on the technology side using data science using continuous improvement so i'd say you know for us at carparts dot com we're in a good spot you guys offer hundreds of uh... thousands of skews uh... give us a percentage though in the last couple of years in the supply chain crunches prices have gone up how much your cost of going up on these parts how much i need to raise prices for the consumer yeah definitely we've seen some pressure on the supply chain not only in the cost of raw materials but also inbound transportation and outbound transportation so it's been across the board not unlike the other uh... traditional retailers or brick and mortar retailers it's been in the double digits obviously we have you know what we think is a competitive advantage we have a vertically integrated supply chain and we always try to pass on whatever savings we can get to the customer but to your point yes the last couple years have been tough for for the customer and it's been you know double digits for sure double digits like are we talking ten percent twenty percent forty percent somewhere between ten and twenty okay the last couple years so we could say teens yeah we like to got there zero in there we do you're you're being a good player david hey i i i would i am where you know as to mention lots of skews lots of manufacturing how has the geopolitical instabilities um... the trade pushback the pushback against globalization um... how is that impacting you about where you want to manufacture everything yeah that's a very good question and it's something that we've been thinking about for a very long time uh... you know we source parts look globally now obviously there is a high concentration in you know in aia and so we've been looking to diversify our supply chain and over the last couple of years we added some supply out of south america uh... out of europe and i think long term as the business continues to grow you know we're always going to be sourcing parts from  Over the last couple of years, we added some supply out of South America, out of Europe, and I think long{-}term, as the business continues to grow, we're always going to be sourcing parts from Asia, but there's opportunities in other places.Stocks hire as investors shrugged off federal reserve, policy makers warnings that interest rates still have to head higher.And FedEx has diffused a threat by its delivery contractors to walk off the job on Black

And how much just chaos that unleashed where you had impersonators of President Biden and other world leaders and companies like Eli Lilly and all the instability there, prominent figures being basically spoofed on the platform.And it raises all sorts of concerns, you know, particularly when those countries are also, you know, regulating Twitter, when they have interest in maybe styming some free speech on the platform, Elon has put himself in a unique and extraordinarily difficult situation.It's it's a tragedy like across the board and hopefully it does send a signal to other CEOs and other venture capitalists, but you know, Caroline, we're coming up with this major scandal in the crypto world and the lessons are there for the investors who who backed SPF and FTX and they were ignored.So I'd love to say that Silicon Valley has learned its lesson, but I think the history of financial scandal in this country and in the world is that there are always new mistakes to be made despite the hefty sentence that's been leveled here today.Coming up, we'll also speak with the new Grindr CEO, George Arison, about everything from his first couple of months in the top role to his big ideas for the popular dating app.It's offices until Monday after Elon Musk gave staff an ultimatum to either commit to working long hours at high intensity or to leave.We have a World Cup coming up and people still will engage with Twitter, but the real risk here is the service may go down because there is no one doing the basic maintenance in terms of taking care of laws and the underlying infrastructure.I guess, you know, what I've learned in recent weeks, with this growth story that Musk is talking about, more users coming to the platform, is the role of the content creator, right?uh sort of the melting of them like looking at them all like they're all for everybody doing everything all of the time right not finally we're realizing and we're seeing this movement towards absolute discordant thing is that we're realizing not every platform can be for everybody all the time right we're seeing these mass layoffs on these big bets not playing out and I think it would be nice to see a future where um the platforms that survive and this is a likely future are the ones that actually like define their audience and focus on them really clearly and I think Twitter has got to leg up in that sense because it's like it's one of the platforms where it's extremely clear who uses Twitter right who gets valued from Twitter and there are you know young active we're talking about young people activists right like there are there are very specific communities for whom that actually make Twitter really really culturally relevant and if you don't have the biggest if you were advising now Elon Musk on how to make it more for content creators how to now lean in to making really unique storytelling ways in which I'm looking at my own Twitter feed right now and the amount of people who are giving me their Instagram links their TikTok links because they're worried as to where next they're going to be and be able to have these conversations in case the platform doesn't survive but if it does and if we manage to see it innovate do you want to see return to Periscope do you want to see more video products what do you want to do as someone who advises companies on attracting a team community on providing content yeah I mean it's I say like every platform the future is multi{-}format right like we they're used to we kind of sometimes treat social media like it's you know 2013 where each platform has a thing they're good at so like Instagram's images YouTube's video Twitter is text and you know ever that you're supposed to do a separate thing on each platform but the reality is every person's doing everything check later if you're a content creator right it's best expected to do every format and every platform so it's that's a lot and I do think like Twitter is behind in terms of the amount like the types of formats you can use if you want to go on and express yourself you're part of one of their core communities right like the video sucks it's insane the video sucks on the platform it's crazy but it does so being multi{-}format in like a real way catching up to everyone in that sense and then focusing in on the actual communities that that utilize their product and that are already their foundational communities would be my suggestion Liz I'm just going to follow up in terms of your moderation focus as well because of course we're hearing from Europe that they are worried about moderation in particular that they've got a different type of type of consideration there in terms of actual real rules real policy real fines for you if you don't live up to the content moderation that they want to see particularly against hate speech but how much is that something that you have to be thinking about when you're advising these companies and how much worry and reticence there is of companies at the moment aligning themselves with come with social media platforms that don't seem to care about it enough right I mean I think first of all um you well Roth who was form Twitter's former head of safety wrote an op{-}ed for New York Times about content moderation in Twitter that's like the mastery today that talks a lot about the fact that like outside forces really do influence and enforce in many ways like moderation on any platform you know including for example the app store but yeah different countries of different child safety laws for example so it is something you have to keep in mind and when I see news like you know hundreds or thousands of contractors being like oh from a big social media company you always I will always assume it's content moderation because right now every company outsources that and I think that you know these are vitally important jobs and I can't help but wonder how much safer and cleaner for advertisers these platforms would be if they were able to keep these teams in houses they scale right and then also like are you know be able to treat treat them regionally and globally so that's like a that's something I think about a lot and it's too bad that it's right now these teams are treated a little bit like they're expendable yeah I think a lot more to learn on the fallout there form ahead of team community at Instagram Liz Pearl thank you coming up can FTX investors get their money back we'll chat with the CEO of do not pay who's trying to do just that this is playing back  I'm making bones fill me up.But there are other things you can do, like these workarounds with reversing the funds, contacting your credit card company, taking third parties to small claims court who aren't being properly held responsible.Well, looking at the other backers that you have, of course, the Andresons, the founders fund, the Luxes, I mean you've taken money from standout Silicon Valley players and it's notable of the lessons now learnt, but we really thank you for your clarity and for really being so true to yourself with us, we appreciate it.Do not pay, see you, Josh Browder, stay well, meanwhile coming up, more culture clash at the World Cup in Qatar, and the first whistle that's going to be blowing your head, let's bring it back.%

I welcome you as the spring ............ m The great sci{-}fi art of the mid{-}20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space.But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long awaited future could be here sooner than we think.But government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting.Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness.Hey Lee, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida.Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth.Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal.But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company.Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives fundamentally the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such.This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney.When you find the super special beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like, looking where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals.The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one{-}fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts.%
