The Gulf States been under intense scrutiny leading up to the tournament over the treatment of migrant workers who built seven new stadiums, as well as concerns about human rights, and its criminalization of homosexuality.Niners statement, the company that disputes the allegations saying that they are creating a safe environment and it's all part of its operating procedures as spokesperson declining to comment on specific complaints.They wanted to thank him for his unprecedented efforts in dealing with the challenges of the pandemic, but they believe Igar is the CEO to lead them through what they call in increasingly complex period for the company and transformation.All right, well, we will wait just over two hours now until that deadline from the King Richard Welsh from the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute Malaysia with me live here in Kuala Lumpur, Rish.While Tesla's in the like, make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.Nego Shaders in Egypt strike a deal on climate justice, but the final compromise leaves big doubt over the prospect for new efforts to curb emissions.Otherwise in Asia, we're also focused on just how serious fed officials are about to this possible pivot as well in rate hikes for the size and the magnitude moving forward in the months ahead.That in turn has raised concerns that as infection numbers increase, we will see more of the old strategies, the lockdowns, the mass testing return and that opening that started a couple of weeks ago will potentially the worries slow.Approved without a single opposing voice, the agreement creates a fund that helps developing nations face the devastation of climate change, although the deal is a historic victory negotiators failed to secure commitments for more ambitious cuts on greenhouse gas emissions.I have bullish consensus for Chinese shares has emerged on Wall Street, but the country's first COVID fatalities in months and title restrictions and some districts are denting optimism considerably on the Hang Seng.We had the fund manager survey that showed that a lot of investors are piling into some of the dollar shorts on a bet that we're going to reach peak Fed hikes, most since July 2021 and then Brent Crude down 1 percent.Let's get to another important voice and that is the IMF managing director, Kristalina Girogeva, because she says the trade barriers against China and other countries could cost the global economy 1.4 trillion dollars.%

It is up to our leaders in the region to call for military presence if need be but our specific bilateral with international health guide and PNG the context has no desire and that matter has China proposed for instance.I want to get to the Malaysian political leaders because they have about two hours before they're due to inform the king of their choice of prime minister after Saturday's election failed to produce a clear winner.Yeah well I mean and this really comes down to what Bloomberg uses about two Yusuf it's about the economy I mean my producer and I spend a fair bit of time on the weekend at wet markets at hawker centres is about people trying to put food on the table you have a minimum average salary of 1500 ring at per month that is about \textbackslash{}\$329 US dollars and it is about three times less than Malaysia's own central bank said was the basic cost of living back in 2018 so you can imagine when people can't afford to put food on the table this is what drove them to the polls this is about what they want economic stability and they also want political integrity remember four years ago that shocked defeat of being was caused by the one mdb scandal with the former prime minister Najib Razak in jail now too and of course it's all about foreign inflows and foreign attracting foreign investment too because you've got a Malaytas key benchmarked down by about 24 percent from its record high in April 2018 Yusuf.But also for a place like the UAE which has very well established world class infrastructure that has the ability to offer essentially shuttle flights back to and from Doha every single day.It's going to be another sort of kind of feather in the cap I think for the UAE in terms of promoting it as a viable and very sustainable tourist site for a lot of visitors coming in from other countries that are participating in the World Cup or who just football fans.That's really interesting so you disagree then with the Goldman Sachs call that they cut their oil price forecast by \textbackslash{}\$10 a barrel for the fourth quarter 2022 you would suggest that markets are tight.We were talking about the World Cup quite a bit and you think about travel and the price of booking it ticket these days and what came to my mind is some of the TSA there that we got out of the United States and it tells a story of a relative moderation given the strong rebound we had after the re{-}opening we'll kind of the feature of 2021 you take a look at the back end of that chart towards the end of 2022 and you can see how it kind of begins to level off a little bit and that is something to bear in mind as we begin to calculate different scenarios for a recession and how those could ripple through the demand side of the equation from there I take you to equity futures in the United States on this Monday we are called a little bit lower about three tenths of one percent bear in mind that we had of course quite a bit of nervousness around what is going on with COVID{-}0 and some cities that were meant to re{-}opening clearly not re{-}opening as fast and in some cases even closing down again a city with as many as 11 million people and that goes contrary to a lot of the optimism that was priced in over the last two weeks in terms of trading activity from equity futures I take you to treasuries as well as we think about what the Fed may do over the next couple of meetings US{-}10s I've kind of consolidated around the key level 380 379 52 as we speak and from treasuries I take you to Brent Crude which is front and center this morning both because of the price move itself coming off the back of severe losses over the last trading week and now down 1\textbackslash{}\% in today just building on those losses and getting ever closer to the \textbackslash{}\$85 a barrel mark the Goldman Sachs note is a bit of a wake up call that maybe it's time to revisit a lot of the assumptions that you would have had three or four weeks ago and we will of course debate that throughout the morning we haven't talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum as much as we have talked about FTX so that's what we're going to do now and the risk off narrative really feeding into the straight as well we're so holding about \textbackslash{}\$16,000 which is notable given some of the developments over the weekend and the exposure of certain unchecked creditors at FTX or 2 FTX rather which is one of the most red stories of the morning the coverage continues from Dubai from Doha from London and the rest of the world I'm going to be rooting for Switzerland but they're not playing until Thursday so I have to put my cap in my t{-}shirt sort of to decide for the moment minus joins me in a couple of minutes this is Bloomberg .And the football world cup finally kicks out from Qatar with a lavish opening ceremony after a build{-}up that's been marred by controversy were live in Doha for the latest.So of course, what you're seeing is, you know,  Quickly in a COVID{-}19 population as China is we know that winters come in cold weather setting in and that's the favorite conditions for the virus So of course what you're seeing is you know spread really kick off in all of these major cities But officials not having those tools that they had previously Haribas is the data Rachel we're looking here Beijing reported three COVID deaths over the weekend and that's the first documented Death since May That's right, you know the cases in Beijing are really a low number for a city of over 20 million You know about 400 500 cases a day the fact that we're seeing these fatalities come so soon, you know in that outbreak Really shows the vulnerability of the Chinese population We know that for example the population of 80 years old and above only 40\textbackslash{}\% of them have gotten booster shots So you know this is a country of 1.4 billion people which has not really been infected by COVID at all for the last two and a half years Leaving you know really millions of vulnerable elderly and that is going to be a major concern for China as it contemplates opening up Okay Rachel.It's certainly shaking the markets this morning Let's see what the reaction function actually is Rachel there with the very latest Well the 2022 World Cup has kicked off in Kanta and the lavish opening ceremony Before the match between the hosts and Ecuador made the TV screens last night.Yeah, I did a survey here of 76 corporate sponsors either based in North America so Canada US or in Europe where criticism of the world cup has been particularly vehement We also surveyed as several seven FIFA sponsors based in those same countries and the message I came away with is Yes, there's been all this criticism of the human rights abuses in Qatar But companies are really not changing their tune in terms of global advertising strategy 13 companies mainly in Belgium Denmark and the Netherlands did say they they sort of got together as a group and said We're we're gonna change the way we do this.This includes more than a dozen on Sunday morning, the IAEA says some buildings and systems were damaged, but non{-}critically, the rains

We're down about two fifths of 1\textbackslash{}\% keep an eye out for Disney as well with company bringing back Bob Iger in a surprise move, ousting the CEO currency above Chapeck.So ahead of that we are seeing Bonnual looking a failing mixed in the trading session today but also giving an eye on what's happening with the dollar because more strength coming back into the currency and that is sending some in Asia law particularly the Korean one.Jules of course is in Malaysia for us in Kuwait, Lumpur for the results of the election on the weekend so more details in just a moment but essentially the first hung parliament ever that is basically the worst case scenario for investors.particular a chowtie fork one of them for instance the retailer of jewellery down around nearly 10\textbackslash{}\% at one stage but airlines airports tourism all very much in focus manners And I mean the question is I mean there was such bullishness last week in terms of you know time to Reenter China taking incremental risk get involved in it.That's it was quite an interesting about a turn that came last week It has really been pretty much whipsawed from Wall Street over the past few months as to whether you should be buying into this But definitely it seems that sentiment is once back again in favor of China Even with this latest sell{-}off to city group is one of them saying that essentially this is a good entry point for investors and basically that we have this reopening at least To ostensibly officials are committed to easing somewhat from COVID{-}0 You also have that ongoing support for the property sector.So these two factors Combine really support the current EPS downturn and then also help Investors sentiment that though are adding a caveat here that they're not going to be chasing this rally aggressively That's one story Bank of America is another out with a note just in the last couple of hours and again They're saying that in the short term.You've been on the ground for A few days you've had a chance to speak to some of the people there It's just give us a bit of an overview of what stood out to you in terms of dominant concerns among voters Yeah, well, it's about the economy You said if it's about rising prices I mean many cannot afford to put food on the table You have the average national minimum salary per month that 1500 ringate the central bank itself said back in 2018 Couple should have 4500 ringate a month or 6500 if they have children just to put that in context 1500 ringate a month is about 329 dollars We've also had the rising cost of chicken which is a key staple of the Malaysian diet Really rise above the government's price cap as well of \textbackslash{}\$2.7 US per kilo And you have these rising inflationary pressures just really hurting the overall Malaysians at the same time You've seen foreign investment really decline as well and the Malaysian market as we're seeing very much hit today But down about 24\textbackslash{}\% from its 2018 peak a week ringate to it that 24{-}year{-}long  really decline as well and the Malaysian market as we're seeing very much hit today but down about 24\textbackslash{}\% from its 2018 peak a week ringer to at that 24 year low not good news for Malaysia which is a net food import and minus use of.Yeah we might have an issue with standards on that I mean look it was a very exciting opening ceremony certainly the match a little less so but certainly a good atmosphere in the stands for most of the game until some of particularly the Qatar supporters left as it became clear who was going to win.Yeah well we're certainly waiting for the excitement to kind of pick up on the ground but there are some big matches going on today I'll be at USA Wales this evening there's also going to be a big game between Netherlands and Senegal those are the two top teams expected to lead in that specific group but I think all eyes really going to be on England versus Iran so the Iranian team has been team Mellie has been a united force for the Iranian people over the past couple of decades but now the reaction to these matches is really divided we've seen lots of activists supporters of the demonstrators in Iran coming out saying we don't want to celebrate and in fact some of them called for Iran to be banned from this world cup altogether we've also heard about some divided views within the Iranian team itself so we're going to be watching for any even subtle gestures perhaps in support of the protest moving going on in Iran but we're also going to be watching the English team as well the English team supposed to take in me ahead of the tournament and support of LGBTQ rights and the big question mark does Captain Harry Kane wear his one love arm band even though he may be immediately booked for doing so we will be watching out for that also watching out to see how sponsors respond to his decision yeah that has been a great deal made over the armband and a number of sportsmen and women who have accepted a lot of fees in support of the world cup and a lot of protests around that Simone I'm sure we will talk about this continually throughout throughout the games as well as the football Simone Foxme the Catafanancial Centre in Doha let's talk about the Marcus Nile equities to be precise Farah Abrahi is around the

It's just you're running the mill punter who might have savings or just investments with you have their crypto investments In the FTX exchange all of these are likely to be affected Unfortunately, it looks as though that sort of retail investor if you want to call it that is like to be the last one on the food chain to get Get their piece of the pie so it's not looking good for all of these companies the fear is of course that if they have Huge losses at FTX that some of the big companies have to sell their holdings elsewhere Yeah, it's interesting that the liquidator has found pockets of liquidity and nearly 50 million dollars in cash Which caught my eye this morning Alex will see you through the day.That's quick takes Alex Web on the big tech stories of the day Now as we've been saying China has reported its first covert deaths since May and cases are spiking nationwide Hiding the concern that cities including the capital could return to a tougher set of regimes and restrictions Amoeu Brian is there for us on this story Emma the very latest I mean this is about concern About the velocity of the kind of contagion risk that we saw through Omicron just high fibrill is the situation in terms of lockdown to remaining open Yeah, I mean, I think you are at a make{-}up break point when it comes to China's Covert pivot they've pushed out this new set of parameters and now it's truly being tested by not only the uptick in cases But the onset of winter You are at this point in the COVID curve where you are going to start seeing deaths in addition to that first death in about six months That came out on Saturday.So you are seeing the chickens coming home to risk somewhat when it comes to this wave And so we'll provide the ultimate test in many ways of the resolve of officials on whether they they are going to follow these rules Or whether they are going to sort of ease back into the restrictions that they know how to do and we are seeing some signs of that Shijiaatuan which is a city close to Beijing It was rumored a week ago that it was going to be a pilot testing site for full reopening of China Because they got rid of a whole lot of testing in line with these new parameters Well this morning they've basically gone back into COVID{-}0 They've advised people to stay at home a whole bunch of high{-}risk areas people are not allowed to leave their homes They're mass testing again something that was discouraged in these 20 new guidelines that were put out just a week ago So we are seeing a reversion to that playbook as cases do Tick higher so we're at a little bit of a knife said just to whether we see people Officials going back to that in orbit name Or whether they start to tolerate higher case levels and deaths Bloomberg's Emma O'Brien incidentally on the ultimate test then as she described it for officials in China as they face up to this surge in cases And which is of course butting heads with this 20 point plan to try and ease restrictions generally right the gochators that UN COP27 climate summit I've reached an historic last minute deal on payments for climate damages Let's get out to Bloomberg's Jennifer to besagged then who's in Sham Elshake Jen what has finally been agreed then?Yeah, Tom, I mean I'm a number of people are calling this historic especially when you think about the 30 years that it took to actually get loss and damage on the formal agenda at COP27 So it is significant because this fund is now a win for poor developing nations who have been calling For what some people call compensation climate reparations for the effects of climate change But a lot of the concerns are what happens next right because a lot of the text surrounding how is it financed how is it structured And our nations like China and other oil producing states donors or recipients that's still not being addressed But when it comes to to the deal itself We did see a number of nations agreed to reaffirm to keep temperatures below 1.5 Degrees Celsius, but really the biggest criticism out of this summit was was the cover decision And not strengthening some of the language that we saw from Glasgow at COP27  that degrees Celsius.And that's where, of course, where some are as a politician and as someone with a strong policy background is taking the cautious view, which makes perfect sense, because they have this asymmetric risk that he highlights, and they do want to be sort of very cognizant of the fact that they have to maintain credibility.All right, coming up, Rishi Sunoz's government is forced to deny that the UK is seeking a closer relationship with the EU after a ports emerge, it's looking into a Swiss style deal with Brussels.Towing debts, court papers show that Sam Bankman freeds

\textbackslash{}\$220 million investors continue to pull funds from digital asset exchanges despite efforts to reassure markets about their stability.And so, COP and is wound up, but the UK government is also in focus as they have denied that they're seeking a Swiss{-}style relationship with the European Union outcomes after the Sunday Times reported that British SNHF administration is exploring the options that would likely anger many within the party.Part one, the Autumn Statement last Thursday, was focused on calming the markets after a pretty difficult mini{-}budget, and also on combating inflation, which was the Prime Minister's state of aim.We'll leave it to Anna and Mark in Singapore and London to take you through Bloomberg markets, Europe, the first reaction to the breaking news that the PBOC, the bank regulator urging stabilization in property finance.%

So as much as corporate CEOs go out there and they talk about ESG and social impact, you know what I found was \textbackslash{}\$ add dollars, five billion viewers potentially watching the world cup.And we've turned a bit of a corner on the China story, now worrying about the reaction function we're going to see from Chinese authorities, whether it'll be the old COVID{-}zero playbook, as cases rise.We've seen a massive rally in Chinese sensitive stocks as a result, but now concerned back to the forefront that tighter curves could go into place after those reported deaths over the weekend.Well, now Disney is bringing back its former CEO Bob Eiger to run the company, which is a surprise moved by the board after a string of disappointing results by Chepek.The country's first COVID related deaths in almost six months are sparking concern that Beijing could see a return of tighter curves and occur in our chief Asia economics correspondent joins us now from Hong Kong with more.Officials are obviously at a very delicate stage because in the one hand, of course, we had a signalling from the top of government that it could be some more targeted kind of restrictions to slow down the pace of COVID spreading rather than the blanket lockdowns we've seen in the past.New court papers show Sam Bankman, Fried's, Bankrupt, Empire owes its 50 biggest, unsecured creditors customers that is as total of \textbackslash{}\$3.1 billion.Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned U.S. policymakers to focus on building the country's own economic strengths in its contest with China, rather than attacking its adversary.The Gulf state's been under intense scrutiny leading up to the tournament over the treatment of migrant workers who built seven new stadiums as well as concerns about human rights and its criminalization of homosexuality.And American musician Ye, of course formerly Kanye West, returns to Twitter after a two week hiatus from the social network and the new owner Elon Musk welcomed him back to the platform.But on the point of Elon Musk's decisions, it is interesting to see him restoring accounts that frankly were deactivated for a reason because of concern around the spread of false misinformation and also anti{-}Semitic and other hateful content.We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to and I think that's the right thing so that for the long term, Shake{-}Chack continues to be what we're building which is the next generation's burger joint.%

But back to the crypto story you were mentioning, Matt, the kind of ripple effects contagion concern around FTX and the fact that Bitcoin prices are lower.And then for the China story that you and Anna were mentioning off the top, they're concerned that the reopening of the economy maybe is not actually going to be coming so soon as cases rise and the first deaths in the country were reported in six months over at the weekend.So we've got the European stocks on the back, but down by two tenths of one percent, just as we see US features a little bit weaker, the big global story coming out of China, it seems to dominate.But Neil Kashkari, you know, if the Fed has a very different view on this, the team is tweeting at the end of last week that this isn't the case of one fraudulent company in a serious industry.And Kaylee, happening right now, the UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, is speaking at the Confederation of British Industry Conference in Birmingham.Discounts are expected to be higher this year to help drive purchases and all the while Anna, we will be slightly distracted by soccer or football as you call it with the world's.And obviously can't follow what the activists have told them, which is bringing, highlighting the controversial human rights issues in this country and around the world as a part of being players on the field.The U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs are likely to meet for their first talks since Beijing suspended dialogue with Washington, overhouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's August visit to Taiwan.Strategists including Peter Oppenheimer and Sharon Bell predict markets will reach a final trough next year before a strong rebound.I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum.The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto so it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's a statement.So there hasn't yet been a satisfying explanation, I think, on China's vaccination rate, but there is a lot of focus on a due to start to ramp that up among the elderly and then beat your point.%

But when you have the government, the officials talk to each other on climate change, your own security or an economic matters, they're thinking that's obviously that's obviously bowed well compared to where they were before the G20 meeting between the two leaders.hours a day Bloomberg your global business authority multi trillion dollar industry there's a lot of ground to cover come on these got absolutely crushed we'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg Bloomberg so you know good morning everyone Lisa Ram what's in time can John Farrell on assignment this morning at eight o'clock scheduled in Doha England uh uh ram that is assignment so that's his assignment today you know it's like a world cup assignment that nobody's you know I mean can you blame me the guys encyclopedia on this could I go on assignment wait for him to get back I think we should call go an assignment I mean the finals December 18th so we got a long way to go there's like 14 brackets and you know did you watch yesterday I watched the highlights and I felt really bad for the color team honestly because yeah they they their nation had built up this entire ecosystem around it and then they just froze they didn't show up and Ecuador are absolutely crushed that nobody was left in the stadium and so you don't you wonder whether they can bring a back three mandated games right television is clicking off radio stations changing worldwide as you and I let's move on futures negative 21 and of course we're watching Disney will have some coverage a mr. Iger back to Disney as well we just spoke to our wonderful endocurrent in Hong Kong about the moment again for China and COVID right now with the data negative 21 rates they're giving me no help today oil a little bit like 79 68 on West Texas intermediate and some dollar strength finally we catch up on a narrow topic with Carl Weinberg he's chief economist managing director of high frequency economics sector Weinberg I have noticed it's not my chart of the year but it well could be the Bloomberg financial conditions index compare between the United States and the EU has never been wider Europe on a financial conditions basic basis is flat on its back what does that mean for the ECB in terms of their efforts to be responsible and to do quantitative tightening hey good morning Tom thank you for finding something on Bloomberg that even I couldn't find in terms of the financial conditions index what we're looking at what we're highlighting to readers of high frequency economics this morning is a huge change in what you just described the ECB's monetary stance is going to take a huge step tighter on Wednesday morning specifically they have raised the rates on their repose banks have the opportunity to pay them back they've signaled 296.2 billion euros worth of long{-}term depots to be paid back on Thursday on Wednesday morning that's going to increase the stock of bonds available to the market by 296.2 billion euros in one day and that should be a massive step toward reducing real money supply getting rid of the excess cash balances that are out there and more importantly increasing the supply of bonds and raising long{-}term yields.Are you saying over in Europe and perhaps in the US, that is not the correct trade that you're gonna see yields on the longer end, on longer{-}term treasuries and guilt and boons go up, not down into a downturn.Are you saying that they don't have the conviction to do that or just that all of the financial engineering over the past couple of decades is coming home to roost and that that long end will continue to go up for a longer period of time with higher real yields?Former Treasury Secretary Lauren Summers warned US policymakers to focus on building the country's own economic strengths in its contest with China, rather than on attacking its adversary.Qatar is under intense scrutiny leading up to the World Cup over the treatment of migrant workers, as well as concerns about human rights and its criminalization of homosexuality.But I don't see any sign, for example, that China is lending a hand to deal with North Korea, which is busy building up nuclear weapons and shooting off missiles.And that's something if people on the left and the right wanted to free up money to devote to domestic causes, they could focus very much on the size of America's debt.Chinese stocks in the yuan retreated as a string of reported Covid deaths and tighter restrictions in some districts gave investors a rude reminder the path to any reopening will be rough.A city near Beijing that was rumored to be a test case for removing virus restrictions across China has asked residents to stay at home for five days.Strategists including Peter Oppenheimer and Sharon Bell predict markets will reach a final trough next year before a strong rebound.We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to and I think that's the right thing so that for the long term, Shake{-}Chack continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint.%

Susan Collins of Boston managing the message forward for the Fed Mary daily as a lonely speaker today.I mean it's it's good anyway there's the Fed speak today we won't ask Mary daily today what she's going to cook for things you may Alex Web doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving he's in London and joins us now with Bloomberg quick take in here on the many happy thoughts as Peter Pan said to Wendy John and I think it was Alex as well and Peter Pan think happy thoughts Alex to begin there are not happy thoughts today at Disney there is repair what does Mr. Eiger have to repair?Yeah, I mean I think that what had happened during lockdown and not to the labor the analogy too much but there was second start of the right carry on some morning while morning has arrived and actually what they were trying to do during the lock downs was under pressure from activists and investors they pivoted basically towards being a gross stock they cut the dividend they invested that in Disney plus in content for Disney plus with the hope that they would get close to the 50 plus price to forward earnings multiple the netflix was enjoying at the time and that worked it worked during the lockdowns of course what we now seen is that there's a with rising interest rates we've seen flight away from from growth stocks and we've seen therefore netflix shares come down of course exacerbated by stagnating user growth and Disney shares come down as well Disney has reinstated the dividend but is still far lower than it was three four years ago so the question for Bob Eiger is like do you take more capital away from Disney plus and do you then try to return some of that capital investors because you know returns now what people sort of more immediate returns of what investors are looking for Alex that's the financial here I'm very fascinated by the creative side of which mr. Eiger excels is he simply a caretaker is they go out and find a new creative CEO he clearly is a caretaker in the sense that he's been given a two year contract and it's hard given his age to imagine that would be extended much beyond that even though he saw his contract extended time and again you know before he ultimately hands it over to Bob Chapeck look his approach to Disney was trying to stabilize earnings by investing in franchises we saw that with Pixar we saw that with Marvel and we saw that with Star Wars who's with you know Lucas film where they built these franchises where you could pretty much be guaranteed you'd be getting an audience for their films that helps stabilize revenue over a relatively long period now the calculations a little bit different as we look at the streaming world where you need to have so much more content it's not just tent poles you need a regular cadence that is very capital intensive and now the market is question was  You look at the streaming world where you need to have so much more content.I think you're right that there is a broader piece here that lots of other companies, particularly as we say, these kind of inadvertent commerce gross stocks have had to do a little bit of correction.Yes, you might think that cable is a dying business or is in slow long term decline, but it still remains highly profitable and generates a huge amount of cash.Well, there's a difference between someone who is now a creditor at FTX, a customer who lost money, and people who keep their Bitcoin, for example, in cold storage off these sort of hot wallets, who have them really stored on the blockchain.Peter, how much are you seeing some sort of, I don't know, whales and how much are you seeing something where it's a realistic pricing action of institutions having fully adopted a crypto asset, even if it does lose favor to some degree?It's like how do you confirm on a daily basis that what you think you hold in the crypto world is legitimately there without maybe publishing it and exposing yourself to theft or hacking?Former Treasury Secretary Lauren Summers warned US policymakers to focus on building the country's own economic strengths in its contest with China, rather than non{-}attacking its adversary.Damien Villal led the region for about seven years, a number of workers at the Paris office, which had fewer than 50 employees before billionaire Elon Musk took over last month, are focused on advertiser relationships.He said he felt discriminated against as a guy with red hair and freckles living in a foreign country and compared that to the experience of gaze, Africans and the like.Go long bonds, David Riley, Chief of Vestus Stragis at Blue Bay Asset Management here to weigh in.%

fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's a statement.You mean when derivatives actually had a concrete purpose in the world, when companies, if you're a lumberyard, you've got to actually hedge against the lumber prices going down in order to back that up.I think as soon as Q1, China potentially

in retrospect to be the wrong decisions, whether it was, you know, buying all{-}stum, selling NBC Universal too cheaply, kind of freaking out during the 2008 financial crisis, getting out of GE capital, bringing in triumph Nelson Pellis thinking that Nelson Pellis would ratify his vision for GE and then promising earnings for share that he couldn't achieve.Could this process exist today or the market so open and visible particularly to activism that we couldn't redo GE Welch to Imilt?Jeff thought it would be a good idea to invite Nelson Peltz to come into the equity of GE in 2015 to ratify his decision to sell G capital.%

Lisa I think it's problematic I mean you know the credit market is kind of living in a fantasy land right now they're they're really pricing in just an ideal scenario where the economy slows just enough to bring down inflation not enough to you know dendt earnings growth or increase increase to false much and I think that's just sort of a bad hypothesis I mean you look at 2023 and it's clear we're going to go into an earnings recession you know high yield credit for example it does not do well when you go into an earnings recession it doesn't matter how strong you know balance sheets are today they're going to weaken as earnings growth slows and then of course listen you've got much higher rates and incredibly tight lending standards and that's going to improve problematic for portions of the loan market anybody who has to refinance in the next couple of years and I think sentiment's going to get dinged up pretty bad and that's not good for for broad risk assets and that really speaks to what Peter Oppenheimer was talking about and hopefully we can reconnect with him given the technology fissures but I wonder Jack from your standpoint over at JP Morgan whether you do agree that there is going to be a trough further out in the disses before we get to that capitulation after which perhaps you could get a more sustainable rally but we're not there yet yeah I mean I would certainly agree that the credit fundamentals don't really line up with with what reality is showing us I guess on the equity side of things the silver lining here the good news here if you want to if you want to be sort of optimistic about it glass half full is that well a lot of what's happened this year in fact basically everything that's happened this year has been driven by multiple compression so the good news going into 2023 from an equity market perspective is that stocks aren't expensive anymore at least not in the way that they were at the start of the year the problem of course is that that earnings shoe has not really dropped yet and the big question right now is just how bad our earnings going to be as we move through 2023 I don't think anybody is expecting good news from an earnings perspective it's really just a question of how bad it actually is but from that valuation perspective the multiple perspective Lisa that is at least one thing that's keeping me modestly optimistic about about short term equity performance potential and this this sort of tension right now between valuations being low but potential outlooks deteriorating has been highlighted by a lot of Wall Street research including Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson who just wrote quote we still expect higher highs for this tactical rally so that's the positive before the deteriorating fundamentals that's the negative take us to lower bear markets market lows next year how much jack have we already seen though some of that disappointment blood into this last quarters results because there were a lot of disappointments and they were severely punished by the market action this whole year has been a disappointment I mean it's been an extraordinarily challenging year to be a strategist and try to figure out where things are going over the short or medium term because at every turn you are being challenged by it by something new I mean I could see another 5 10\textbackslash{}\% lower on this equity market I'm not particularly optimistic about this current rally I don't really think it has legs I don't think it has a whole lot to stand on  I mean, I could see another 5{-}10\textbackslash{}\% lower on this equity market.I kind of think it's interesting that most private managers out there tout how you'll realize lower defaults because of their ability to basically shepherd a troubled company through trying times.And that has really been true for the broader group of Chinese companies listed here in the US because of what has been a series of good news events, earnings better than expected, seeming easing of relations between the US and China.We think that there is going to be recession across Europe but even that is likely to be relatively mild and we should acknowledge that private sector balance sheets are pretty good in particular banks and broadly corporates as well but notwithstanding that valuations haven't really yet fallen to the sorts of levels you would tend to get as investors worry about an economic and a profit downturn.Essential banks get a little bit more confident that inflation is closer to a peak but that said you don't typically get markets reach your trough until interest rates actually start to come down and we're still a long way away from that.And so ultimately when I think about the sort of new normal

will be a bumpy ride to get there.So we have a lot of interest in hydrogen, for example, and we're seeing investors looking to diversify their portfolio exposure in that way by picking up, you know,

the time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID{-}19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every one thousand views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views I made 30 cents but then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars and there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down why are they going to make content then instead you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher the second way that a YouTuber makes income is support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off patreon was really the only option but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels so whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special icons next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and for me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t{-}shirts from last year right now you have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you you have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it you're not doing it for other people you're doing it for yourself if you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it huh so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about oh sweet I guess I can make the channel about that now how do I grow an audience how do I get popular it's all about diversification right you have to have a massive twitter following you have to have a massive instagram following you have to have a massive

look at this empire that was built by Barry Silver So I think that is a very important part of this story here which assets within that empire we are talking about And how far that contagion can potentially go as we as we plan for a potential bankruptcy for this unit Yeah, just talk to us a little bit about digital currency group as well and the efforts that will already be made By Barry Silver to we'll prop up that entire industry group because thus far it has been noted that money has been Put there to ensure that certainly post three arrows the implications weren't too destructive It's an important question remember after three arrows a part of the empire here was said do have been a creditor to the three arrows group So why is that so important today because as investors look at this asset to the point that you are getting at here Is that they do want to entangle the relationship between Genesis lending Genesis trading and the rest of digital currency group now Remember the rest of the empire is super important to the crypto space That includes a GBTC the gray scale Bitcoin trust grace scale as a company But right now what we do know and I would say I work about tune us over at Bloomberg intelligence has been brilliant at pointing this out The company itself spits off a lot of money based on what they are getting in terms of managing the assets for the gray scale Bitcoin trust So that's why again, it's so important here to say what is revenue generating what is still okay today and what parts of the business here are we more concerned about but then importantly for investors What is the relationship between all the entities at the end of the day All right Bloomberg's Chaneli Balsac.Let's turn now to Disney after the bombshell announcement the Bob Iger is coming back to the company Ross Gerber is CEO and co{-}founder of Gerber Karrasakini two billion dollars in assets under management and importantly Caroline a Disney shareholder So Ross your reaction Oh, I was so happy when I saw the news last night I thought I was dreaming and and it was like my dream came true I Bob Chepack had had been running the business into the ground and had made some crucial errors and handling some very difficult situations But it was time to really refocus the business back on creating great content for a reasonable cost Okay, so Ross in terms of your prioritization here and I want to bring to our audience a poll that we went to Twitter We then know you're a big player on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of followers But we've been shining a light on what they think the prioritization should be now Is it the cost controls?And a clarification for our Bloomberg technology audience during a discussion on Elizabeth Holmes took place this past Friday when she was given an 11 year sentence in misleading investors.Meanwhile though, there's restructuring going across technology and more broadly mass tech layoffs and left hundreds of workers

Sunday Work as woke up to a to a new calendar invite Sunday morning and then by Midday Sunday there was a all hands meeting affecting basically just trying to give a new direction for where Twitter was going to go By the time it came around to Monday Workers had learned that they've been fired they had been let go which only until January that they'd get They'll still be paid and considered to be an employee as well too and more specifically this affected the sales team And this came as a complete shock specifically because the sentiment was that you know They had been shielded from some of these layoffs that we had been reporting Not only have our viewers been watching this employees at Twitter have been watching our reporting as well too because they didn't know What was coming up next but the whole thought process in the sentiment was that they wouldn't be affected by these layoffs because One thing that Twitter needed was revenue and the sales team was a main driving force behind those things So this came as a complete shot for a lot of workers Camera at the moment.I think at the bottom of the story it really shows that at one point it was 7,000 workers before mask We're now looking at an employee internal counter 2,750 How much is there still to go how much do we inherently need to support a Overall social media empire such as Twitter.There seems to be a lot of confusion going forward I spoke to a source earlier today and apparently there should be a final all{-}hands meeting Happening today that kind of gives the direction of where 22.0 will be going and apparently those are the Just only the staff members that are left and that Elon will be keeping with But that was supposed to be the thought with the last all{-}hands meeting so you never know if this could be the next one It's if this could be the final one So you nobody knows we're sticking close to the situation We'll want to turn on Bloomberg dot com as well Cameron.Genesis has warned of a potential
