When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill.And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged a shook hands and I just fell in love with it.The part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight.A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status.There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market.Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers.The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for.Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringed in the United States.John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting.There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times.At the time that UFC was bought for just \$2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner.They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal.%

Sat us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of the UFC family movie and forward.On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung Li, Nate Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit.A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct the fighters pay would soar as well.And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50\% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing.The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure.The overview of my career from a financial perspective is, you know, something I've had, a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to a rock the entire time I was fighting ahead.A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries, like numerous species, and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones.Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel, equipped with two multi{-}beam Sona systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor.On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcore discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef.We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soymne corn to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated to the end of the day.Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed.XiPek was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship.%

The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development.Other open world games felt empty and enforced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions, and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water.The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself.So Marchiniewinsky, who's a co{-}founder and co{-}CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, Hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project.The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies.North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding.But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong{-}un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military.So what happens is, North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports, called, basically, a symmetric weapons.Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever message, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism.Muscling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs.After the 2008 financial crisis, lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast.When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people.%

In 1968, Ivanshin Art and four friends, including Dag Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina.It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion.During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism.Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community.As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017.After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co{-}founders lured her to Silicon Valley.So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office.It's the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self{-}driving cars, why can't you fix this now?So to me, a really natural part, you know, kind of a sister organization to investing for long term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top.At some point down the road you'll say I wish I made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered what times are we now what's your read on the economy today especially with rising inflation.And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison.The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health.%

That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me.Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day.And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online.Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau.And next thing I know a little while later here I am back at Amazon absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers.So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people and it sounded intriguing although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about.So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff and I would have to say that even by the time I took the job I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in but I also was like well you know we'll just have to see how it goes and you know Amazon's a big big place and so I think we got a lot of a lot of intent to succeed here and that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business.It's a great question big we are currently the leader and I mean depending on which you know third party you you you you look at we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as as number two and it's really important to continue to act as if you know we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents and I like to talk about actually managing the business we want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers and I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company it's all too frequent that you start managing math you start managing ratios and percentages and growth and I think it's it's a real disease if you if you stray away from really focusing in a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you and so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with with our culture and what we choose to focus on and really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things product and customers and if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level then all of a sudden you you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent we got to feel that urgency every day so keep acting like an insurgent that's the motto absolutely and structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to it's one thing to say it but it's easy to say it but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so and we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms now do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever expanding pie or at some point doesn't become a zero some game and that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody well I mean this is a very large market segment if you look at global IT spend it's it's in the trillion  that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody.But it is the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think, really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things.Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias.So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS.I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users.%

Currently, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens.And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real{-}world harm.YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, and entertained, distracted through the pandemic.And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice.You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then.No, I don't think so, but I think it's like Anytime that Frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto right other audiences too It's when it's in the news a lot and when does that happen a lot of times when the prices are going up She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment Taking down Bitcoin Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals She dove deep and became a crypto convert swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase became the first female general partner adventure firm and recent Horowitz Han now a prolific crypto investor recently launched her own fun with one and a half billion dollars to deploy It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures Katie Han Katie, it's so great to have you great to be back here in the studio with you Emily I want to start with a vibe check Okay What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now?I did you clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy That's right you became a federal prosecutor you were taking on prison gangs Yep, and the mafia.That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions, and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed.And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC were cropped.Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation.I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem.One of the things that we told our LPs even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle.%

After spending a few days with the Dominic in here in the rainy city of Portland, I've gotten an insight into a soft spoken native portlandian, family man restaurant tour and real estate investor who's endeavoring to have more impact with his businesses than he's had against quarterbacks in the NFL.We bought the building lived on one side and rented the other side and that's where we really started to learn about real estate or how I started to learn about real estate From those early days, Sue's fascination with an ambition in real estate only grew Especially as a pro football career gave him the means to I bigger and bigger projects He's been buying and building property in his hometown of Portland as well as across the United States Including luxury residential office and hospitality space and affordable housing All with the mission to help build generational wealth through real estate And real estate is one of the most tried and true places to store and grow wealth Buying and owning property commercial or residential when done right can be a source of income as well as a crew value over time That's if you choose projects wisely and have patience over the past few years The pandemic both increased demand and lowered the supply of housing leading to skyrocketing values At the same time Low interest rates made acquiring the capital needed to purchase properties even easier More recently though Rising mortgage rates and new supply have begun to change that picture and rents have been increasing at historic levels owning real estate has the additional benefit of influencing Maybe even transforming the neighborhood and the community around you that's an idea passed down to Sue from his father He assembled a handful of different lots and projects and this is one of them That has been I won't say a unicorn, but it's been very very profitable If you look at the building you have the exterior so we gutted everything inside and kept the exterior facade and then built on top of that It was originally a chop shop when we first took over People at night when I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s would not walk up and down these streets by any means You see it's live you got great restaurants up and down coffee shops further down You got everybody probably knows assault and straw they're right up the street There's no way they would be here back in the 90s.I knew leaving high school, I wanted to get an engineering degree because my ultimate goal is to come back here to Portland and build another division to my dad's company.But his play on the field allowed him to meet and maintain relationships with future mentors in his business career, including the Oracle of Omaha himself Warren Buffett.Ever since then, we've been close friends, confident, and really a true mentor, being able to bounce a bunch of different ideas off, and then also understand how he envisions the world, although he's not fully into real estate, and he's changed a little bit because he now has a brick{-}try halfway home, you know what not.Moglia's career began in the coaching world, but he would rise through the ranks to lead TD Ameritrade as CEO from 2001 to 2008, and Chairman from 2008 to 2020, navigating the company through the global financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as its eventual combination with Schwab.And while coffee shops and breweries are a thing here, the real Portland is a complicated place in a state of near existential crisis facing issues around affordability, the unhoused and crime.While real estate investments have been a great place to store wealth, the recent housing market has left many unable to participate, especially when it comes to BIPOC communities.It may seem complicated, but Joel and Sue believe that programs like Alt cap can give people who've long been excluded from real estate and attainable investment option.If we can get real estate transactions to include everybody, you're talking about \$1 trillion industry that has the ability to engage everybody in a micro fashion earned at a disproportionate rate, you can transition the wealth of our country in short order.Jumphal Clark is the co{-}founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turboprop market.Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits, which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing nox emissions.%

To make green hydrogen, the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource, which is currently a lot more expensive.But thanks to a handful of companies, there's a hidden revolution happening that, as it turns out, is perfectly suited to delivering a cleaner future.Now the book is an Amazon's massive fulfillment network, copies then journey along the so{-}called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers.This system, while it's a marvel of modern{-}day logistics, still relies mostly on traditional combustion engine vehicles for middle and last mile delivery.But while one big problem, vehicle cost, is improving as battery prices continue to fall, there's still another major hurdle at the other end.So what they do, they find the route they need to run, and they agonize over it for four to six weeks, just mapping it inside and out, figuring out where all the trouble spots might be, and coding their vehicles to deal with it.There's a common understanding in the industry that unprotected left turns and doing multiple lane changes are some of the most trickiest problems in the AV space.And as the technology matures and batteries continue to get cheaper, there's another huge category of vehicles that's ripe for this kind of upgrade.While the most exciting and flashy developments in the world of electric vehicles are usually around personal EVs, the more impactful transition is happening behind the scenes.So the next time you order something online, and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline.Some listen, but I think since George Floyd was murdered more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color and it's a slow process.Should be more emotional than you were bring for all the success that need to happen to beenergized maybe because of your We will never break Build on a foundation Strong enough to stay We will never break Have a wide array of things And the mountains shake All of who will remain We will never No, now we will never No Thank you Andy so much for coming down It's really wonderful to have you here in person It's my pleasure to be here thanks for having me I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college Just a few years apart So it's been almost a year since you took over From Jeff as CEO of Amazon It's been a year of first, the first stock split since the dot com boom The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse Your first Bloomberg technology conference Thank you I want to start with a quick report card In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy His longtime top lieutenant The architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services Bezos has stayed on as executive chair Leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny And a push by some warehouse workers to unionize All while keeping customers coming back Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy He joined us from our flagship Bloomberg technology summit in San Francisco I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's perfume  Yes, from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco.%

Alpha Beth Sundart Pichai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Irvin Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start.Add in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world.For no coasts of points to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world.For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance.The company's strategic plan recognized E{-}commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation.CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it.The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Cologne{-}Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals.I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible.I mean the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were ducks, suits and white shirts and look alike.I think the great thing is that now across the board in finance but also in the group overall we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible.I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum.While Teslas and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.%

It wasn't easy for President Biden either as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic patrol.And you know, since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to, not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner because I don't think it ever is, but it was able to spend most of its time dealing with the full employment.And ironically, now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate, but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy.So valuations have had a tremendous reset from the overvaluation days, you know, following the COVID lockdown, when the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be.China's closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings.Elsewhere the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs.And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money.If you put it a longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good, long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaoping?As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like and how they're going to approach the economy.The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think, is very disconcerting for the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency of publication of data is not an encouraging sign.If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida, or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable.And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expecting.%

Finally one more thought and this week it comes from Bloomberg Senior Executive Interfer Economics and Government and it's about her native land.I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea which is the UK has been held back by a slow growth since the global financial crisis.So it was not what she did but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most.And he said, later in life, it was my first encounter with an idea, which is, if you look at nature carefully, and really pay attention, and you're lucky, you can catch your glimpse of something deeply hidden.Yeah, I mean, it's always a cliche, but it's true, a friend of mine, an astronomer always says, when people criticise these spacecraft and they say, you know, let's say the James Webb Space Telescope, what, six billion dollars or so.And what is often the case, so putting aside the glory and wonder of the discoveries that are made, basically you're paying people to do high tech jobs and do research and build machines that operate at the edge of the possible.And all the things that we think led to the origin of life on Earth were present on Mars around the same time, about three and a half to four billion years ago.And I just wanted to ask because the clip that has gone or the image rather I should say that's gone viral recently is of the now convicted sex trafficker, Gelae Maxwell, drawing you as you drew her.You want to pick a certain type, you know, when you're trying to select a jury, I think it really made it hard for them to...

Because of your depiction of Tom Brady, the American footballer in court over a cheating accusation, people saying that your picture didn't look like him.Just at the moment, I remembered Uma Thurman coming to court who's very beautiful and she sat down in the witness box and nobody would ever think the sketch I made was harboring.At the moment, I remembered Uma Thurman coming to court, who's very beautiful, and she sat down in the witness box, and nobody would ever think the sketch I made was her, because she's not looking glamorous.I mean, in the case of Galen Maxwell, bringing it back up, a lot of people make a big thing of what the person looks like when they're found guilty.So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip.Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for industrial Silicon Valley in the United East and Dresden, Horowitz.One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle.And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities.Few companies are better positioned to provide that relief than Mondalees, with a portfolio of more than 60 brands led by nine global powerhouses ranging from chocolate to crackers to cheese.But for the company to make the most of its opportunities, CEO, Dark Vanderputt, depends on CFO, Lucas Aramella, to cut through the clutter and keep this huge ship on course.Like every CFO in 2022, Aramella faces some headwinds, global supply chain challenges, inflation, and ongoing uncertainties around the pandemic, just to name a few.And you're going to do it on a local market area, as opposed to a business silo globally, that inherently creates a challenge that Lou has been able to solve.%

10 years of remarkable growth, that's what President Xi Jinping of China focused on in his speech to the party Congress last Saturday.But Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, who's been back and forth to China over the last 30 years, insists that, despite all the problems, he wouldn't bet against Beijing over the long term.And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money.If you put it in the longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaopeng?As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees which will take place next March will look like and how they're going to approach the economy.The fact that they didn't put out the GDP numbers this week on time, I think, is very disconcerting for the world's second largest economy to place politics over just the standard transparency of publication of data is not an encouraging sign.If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable, given what's happening in other parts of the world, I suspect that the fiscal issue is going to need sooner or later to be back on the table in the United States.Look, David, there's always a tendency at the beginning, or in the early stages of very problematic periods, to assume that everything is going to be resolved much more quickly than actually proves to be the case.And it made sense to also to be spending some money in her initial mini budget on supporting households through a massive energy squeeze as we approach the winter.So it was not what she did, but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most.There's a lot of Shaddon Freude, potentially, and certainly there, but for the grace of God, go eye central bankers and Treasury officials around the world.But I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline, and sort of organization, that is him to a T. are you doubting myJeBiQah turned out in truth, expert analysis.%

Serial clean tech entrepreneur Val Miftikoff started zero aviare following his previous success in the EV charging industry.Calling it simpler might be underselling the challenge of distributing hydrogen, which unlike other fuels that can be easily transported in liquid form, is usually found instead in a gaseous state.Jumpall Clark is the co{-}founder and chief innovation officer of Universal Hydrogen, a startup that is designed a modular tank system for the domestic turbo prop market.Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn at much lower flame temperatures and that's better for reducing nox emissions.Now the book is an Amazon's massive fulfillment network, copies then journey along the so{-}called middle mile, and can be redistributed to any of the hundreds of smaller warehouses or nodes closer to customers in major population centers.So what they do, they find the route they need to run, and they agonize over it for four to six weeks, just mapping it inside and out, figuring out where all the trouble spots might be and coding their vehicles to deal with it.There's a common understanding in the industry that unprotected left turns and doing multiple lane changes are some of the most trickiest problems in the AV space.So the next time you order something online and it effortlessly appears in your doorstep, your package might have made at least some of its hidden journey without consuming an ounce of gasoline.It was founded in 1993 by Chef Turnodrapreneur Steve L.

I think that the companies that win are those that are investing in their employees, their teams that are developing a strong culture that people want to be a part of.It will take us a year and a half from the time that we are experimenting in the test kitchen to, we'll put it into a few restaurants to see how does it work operationally and do customers like it.From responsibly raised meat to local and organic produce, the company's crafted a supply chain carefully over decades.And I'm like, I've got to make sure that our financials and all everything we spend money on needs to be thoughtful so that we can invest in the better way, raising food.For the last 20 years at Chipotle, Jack Hartung has made strategic decisions based on what matters, even in times of turmoil and crisis.I think in terms of evolution, it's probably more a matter of the folks on my team, some of which are new to Chipotle in the last few years, some of which have been with us for a long time, to help them rise up so they can take on bigger responsibilities.Hartfeld and Hanson, Jack Hartung is put Chipotle in position to go forward by always making sure the business goes back to the start and stays true to its roots.She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture firm and recent Horowitz.However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do.That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoening large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed.One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle.And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities.%

It wasn't easy for President Biden, either, as he continued to fight high gas prices for which he largely blamed the oil companies and counted with yet another release from the strategic petroleum reserve.Yeah, now I agree and you know since the financial crisis, the Fed has been able to not so much put the inflation mandate on the back burner because I don't think it ever is but it was able to spend most of its time, you know, dealing with the full employment mandate and then when financial conditions were tightening, they could, you know, exercise the Fed put as we call it of course and ease conditions and get the economy going and inflation was never a clear and present danger and of course now it is and ironically now the Fed is in the position where it needs to not only maybe tolerate a higher unemployment rate but even have that at its goal in order to compensate for the overstimulation that clearly was happening a year or two ago in the economy with that combination of fiscal and monetary policy.We've had a very extended period of extremely loose monetary policy and that forced the UK where you have a higher proportion of defined benefit pension plans.I think the Fed might be left in this completely internally, in coherent position that the Bank of England is in, where it's simultaneously buying gilts, but will continue to raise rates.So valuations have had a tremendous reset from the overvaluation days, you know, following the COVID lockdown when the Fed basically repressed interest rates down to much lower levels than they really deserve to be.China has closely watched party congress wraps this weekend and investors will be awaiting the likely release of GDP and activity data that were delayed during the meetings.Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan will likely stand pat on its ultra low interest rate and asset purchases, despite a plunge in the yen that's driving up import costs.And particularly when you don't have the kind of social safety nets in place, particularly around health, that make people feel comfortable enough and have confidence to spend their money.If you put it a longer course of Chinese history because you've been really very active in China for a good, long time now, are we seeing something of a turn back toward Mao in a way from a Deng Xiaoping?As we look at this new leadership coming in, watching the ideology versus the technocrats is going to be really important and give us a sense of what the government appointees, which will take place next March, will look like and how they're going to approach the economy.If you factor in all the different steps that are being taken, whether it's the student loan debt relief or the emergency funding that's going to take place because of the hurricane in Florida or the increases in national security expenditures that I think are almost inevitable given what's happening in other parts of the world, I suspect that the fiscal issue is going to need sooner or later to be back on the table in the United States.And I think it's a mistake to think that all of our economic challenges are going to be met quickly, particularly if we heed what I think would be the dangerous advice that are coming from the erstwhile members of Team Transitory that the Fed can back off already and not carry through on the increases that the market is now expecting.%

I think Liz Truss started off with the right idea which is the UK has been held back by slow growth since the global financial crisis.So it was not what she did, but the way she did it and the kind of gay abandon with which the government was proposing tax cuts that were not funded by any form of spending constraint, and not targeted to the people who in this particular environment needed help the most.And I think what happened when you saw the new Chancellor installed, the seventh since 2016, you saw potentially those institutional constraints come back, but the Treasury, the Bank of England, is still in charge.We saw a particular investment strategy, the liability driven investments in the UK, which are particular to the UK, mess up the pension market, force the Bank of England to intervene, but we know we saw similar fragility in the US Treasury market back in March of 2020, and there may be other things out there that we should be nervous about, as we see this very significant shift to a higher interest rate environment.Few companies are better positioned to provide that relief than Mondalees with a portfolio of more than 60 brands led by nine global powerhouses ranging from chocolate to crackers to cheese.But for the company to make the most of its opportunities, CEO Dirk Vandiput depends on CFO, Lucas Aramela, to cut through the clutter and keep this huge ship on course.Like every CFO in 2022, Zara Mella faces some headwinds, global supply chain challenges, inflation and ongoing uncertainties around the pandemic, just to name a few.The company projects even stronger top line growth in the next two years, but maintaining margins may be challenging with supply chains still under pressure and the cost of labor and materials rising.You might realize that you don't necessarily carry with you all the time, a big pack of Oreo, but so making the product available in smaller sizes is critical.In its early years, Mondaleys was a takeover target, attracting the attention of billionaire activist investors Bill Ackman and Nelson Peltz.He'd taken a chunk of shares, put pressure on the company, eventually took a board seat from 2014 onwards, and really just said, don't worry about the top line.Edward how do you see the publishing world changing so people buy less magazines you've been man I mean you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more but in five years how does it look how does it look?%

I asked him to arpeachai the CEO of Alphabet in Google this question about kids and tech habits and screen time and he said it's something that even stresses him out.I think the one thing that we're very encouraged is that the time spent on roadblocks tends to be more like hanging out together or being on the phone together or doing stuff together and a lot less of it is isolated, either consuming content by myself or grinding away at something by myself.If you looked at my YouTube history, it's this weird mechanical stuff, off{-}road vehicles, and rockets, and ships, and big waves.Today's CFOs are reshaping the C{-}suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out a traditional role.In some areas, the waves reached 40 meters in height, sweeping up everything in its path, including cars and ships, unable to withstand the strength and the power of the surging water.Japanese engineers and architects have also pushed the boundaries of technology and design to create resilient disaster proof buildings.Design for broadcasting and observation, the base of Skytree occupies a relatively small plot of land that isn't ideal for such a tall structure.Adsuo Konishi and his colleagues designed a steel{-}trust tower, so instead of fighting against the wind, it can simply pass through the gaps between the traces.To stabilize the tower, the team used a traditional Japanese design called Shimbashira that dates back over a thousand years.This is the flexible central pillar of a Japanese pagoda, which stabilizes the tiered wooden structure during an earthquake or typhoon, in a similar way to a tree trunk supporting its branches.For Skytree, the team designed a 375 meter tall concrete core column, connected to the tower's steel outer frame by a series of flexible oil dampers, devices that control unwanted vibrations.The swaying of the core column and outer frame in opposite directions reduce the vibration of the entire tower by up to 50\% during an earthquake and 30\% during strong winds.%
